## Key Observations

### Perfect Fit for This Race (Score 4.0+)
1. **KLAEBO (4.8)** — Elite across every category. Only climbing (4 vs 5) prevents a perfect score.
2. **NISKANEN (4.6)** — Highest classic + endurance combination. Lacks finishing speed.
3. **NYENGET (4.4)** — Elite classic and climbing. Low finishing speed is his only gap.
4. **AMUNDSEN (4.3)** — Strong but classic technique weakness in a classic-only race limits ceiling.
5. **IVERSEN (4.1)** — Strong classic credentials; lacks Klaebo's finishing speed.
6. **HALFVARSSON (4.0)** — Veteran who fits the profile well; fitness is the question.

### Best Classic Technique (Diagonal + DP combined)
1. KLAEBO / NISKANEN / NYENGET (tied at 10/10)
2. IVERSEN / NOTZ / LAPALUS / HALFVARSSON (tied at 8-9/10)

### Best Endurance Profile
1. NISKANEN / NYENGET / MUSGRAVE / SCHELY / BABA (all 5/5)
2. KLAEBO / AMUNDSEN / IVERSEN / SCHUMACHER / HALFVARSSON (all 4/5)

### Biggest Mismatch — Sprint Stars in the Marathon
- **PELLEGRINO (1/5 endurance):** Sprint legend attempting 2+ hour race — romantic farewell but low probability of top finish
- **BARP (2/5 endurance):** Young sprinter with improving distance credentials but untested at 50km

### Classic Technique Advantage
Athletes with the highest combined classic scores (NISKANEN, NYENGET, KLAEBO, IVERSEN) are favored in this format. The 50km classic format amplifies technique advantages over shorter races because fatigue compounds technical inefficiency.
