## Dark Horse #1: Savelii KOROSTELEV (AIN) — BIB 12

**The Controversial Prodigy**

The 22-year-old Russian competing as a neutral athlete has been one of the revelations of the season. After three years locked out of international competition, he returned with an 8th-place Tour de Ski overall and a stunning 4th in the Olympic skiathlon — agonizingly close to a medal.

**Why he could surprise:**
- 4th in the Olympic skiathlon — proved he belongs among the best
- 4th on the Alpe Cermis final climb at Tour de Ski — outstanding climbing ability
- Progressive Tour de Ski trajectory (9th → 12th → 4th) shows he gets stronger as events get longer
- JWC double gold winner (2022) — pedigree of a generational talent
- Burning motivation after missing out on a skiathlon medal by centimeters and having a protest rejected
- At 22, has the youth and recovery capacity for a 50km after the skiathlon effort

**Risk:** First-ever 50km at elite international level. Classic technique strength is strong (JWC classic gold) but untested over marathon distance. Also carries the weight of competing under global political scrutiny.

**Ceiling:** Podium is genuinely possible if the race rewards sustained climbing.

## Dark Horse #2: Mathis DESLOGES (FRA) — BIB 6

**The Triple Silver Sensation**

The 23-year-old Frenchman has already won three silver medals at these Games (skiathlon, 10km free, relay) — making him the most decorated non-Norwegian at MiCo 2026. His breakout from a WC best of 6th to triple Olympic medalist is the story of these Games.

**Why he could surprise:**
- Three Olympic silver medals — riding an unprecedented wave of confidence
- Skiathlon silver (+2.0s behind Klaebo) and 10km free silver demonstrate elite fitness across techniques
- U23 World Champion in mass start — proven in pack racing
- Youth (23) means recovery from prior events is faster than older competitors
- "It's crazy for the French team" — team spirit and momentum are powerful

**Risk:** Has never raced a 50km at the elite level. His WC best was 6th before these Games. Classic technique over 50km is a massive unknown for a skier who has primarily excelled in freestyle. His broken medal (from celebrating the skiathlon) could be symbolic — at some point the fairytale may end.

**Ceiling:** If he has a 4th great race in him, a medal is not impossible. More likely a top-8 finish that would still be remarkable.

## Dark Horse #3: Calle HALFVARSSON (SWE) — BIB 20

**The Veteran's Farewell**

At 36, the four-time Olympian was dropped from the Swedish national team earlier this season before fighting his way back with a stunning 6th in the Oberhof 10km classic. His best 50km result — 5th at WCH Planica 2023, just 0.4 seconds off the podium — is the best in this race among non-favorites.

**Why he could surprise:**
- 5th in WCH 50km Classic at Planica 2023 — proved he can race the distance at the highest level
- WCH relay silver at Val di Fiemme in 2013 — course knowledge from this very venue
- 29 WC podiums across his career — massive experience and race intelligence
- "Nothing to lose" mentality after being dropped and fighting back
- Classic technique has always been strong — won WC events in both techniques

**Risk:** Fitness is the wildcard — he was off the national team just weeks ago. At 36, the 50km physical demands are immense. This is likely his farewell race regardless of result.

**Ceiling:** If fully fit, top-5 is achievable. Has the race intelligence and 50km experience to capitalize if favorites falter.

## Honorable Mentions

### Theo SCHELY (FRA) — BIB 23
- 9th in 50km Classic at WCH Planica 2023; marathon race winner; Olympic relay silver. The Frenchman with the strongest pure 50km classic pedigree outside the favorites. Top-10 is realistic.

### Hugo LAPALUS (FRA) — BIB 8
- 2x Tour de Ski podium (3rd), relay silver at MiCo 2026, and a 3rd at Davos 20km classic this season. France's classic workhorse. Could benefit from team tactics with Desloges, Lovera, and Schely.

### Naoto BABA (JPN) — BIB 28
- 10th in 50km at WCH 2025 Trondheim; 8th in a Val di Fiemme WC race in 2022. A clear marathon specialist who performs dramatically better at 50km than shorter distances. Quiet top-10 contender.

### Gus SCHUMACHER (USA) — BIB 5
- Tour de Ski stage winner, 7th overall TdS. America's distance hope with a developing classic technique. The 50km is a stretch but his aggressive racing style could produce a surprise.
