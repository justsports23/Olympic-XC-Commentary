# Podium Contenders — Men's 50km Mass Start Classic
## Milano Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games
**Venue:** Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium, Val di Fiemme, Trentino, Italy
**Date:** Saturday, 21 February 2026

## Contender #1: Johannes Hoesflot KLAEBO (NOR) — BIB 1

**The Overwhelming Favorite**

Klaebo enters the 50km having already won **five gold medals** at these Games (skiathlon, sprint, 10km, relay, team sprint). A sixth would be the most by any athlete at a single Winter Olympics. He has 116+ World Cup victories, a record 5th Tour de Ski title, and won the 50km Classic at both Oslo 2024 and Lahti 2025. He also won the 50km Mass Start Free at WCH Trondheim 2025.

**Why he wins:**
- Dominant current form — leading all World Cup standings
- Won the 2025 WCH 50km and the Lahti WC 50km Classic in March 2025
- Unmatched finishing kick in a mass start — if the race comes together, nobody can outsprint him
- Confidence at all-time peak after 5 golds at these Games
- Venue familiarity — already won 5 events at Tesero during these Games

**Vulnerability:**
- The 50km has been his Olympic white whale — DNF in Beijing 2022, DQ at WCH 2021 Oberstdorf
- Fatigue — 5 races in 13 days is a massive workload, with the team sprint just 3 days prior
- Mass start classic over 50km is the one format where sustained climbing power can defeat sprint finishing speed
- Climbing ability, while strong, is not his greatest weapon (12th on Alpe Cermis final climb at TdS)

**Prediction:** Gold medal favorite. Only fatigue or a bold early breakaway by a classic specialist could deny him.

## Contender #2: Martin Loewstroem NYENGET (NOR) — BIB 3

**The Classic Technique Master**

Nyenget is arguably the strongest pure classic distance skier in the field. Both of his 2025-26 World Cup victories came in classic technique (10km Classic at Ruka and Oberhof, the latter by a devastating 13.8 seconds). His first-ever WC victory was the 50km Classic at Oslo in 2022, and he pushed Klaebo to within 0.5 seconds in the Lahti 50km Classic.

**Why he podiums:**
- Best classic technique in the field alongside Niskanen — won both WC classic races this season
- Proven 50km racer — won 50km Classic at Oslo 2022, 2nd at Lahti 2025 (+0.5s)
- Already has relay gold and skiathlon bronze at these Games — confidence is high
- "One of the few skiers capable of attacking early and sustaining a solo effort" — his best chance is to break away
- At 33, this may be his last Olympic 50km — maximum motivation
- Emotional resilience — his first WC victory came two weeks after his father's death

**Vulnerability:**
- Cannot outsprint Klaebo if the race comes together at the finish
- Less Olympic individual medal experience than Niskanen

**Prediction:** Top-3 highly likely. Best chance at gold is a sustained solo breakaway on the climbs.

## Contender #3: Iivo NISKANEN (FIN) — BIB 7

**The Defending Champion**

Niskanen is the reigning Olympic 50km champion from PyeongChang 2018 (15km Classic gold). At 34, the Finnish classic specialist has 3 Olympic gold medals and won the Falun 10km Classic by 12.9 seconds over Klaebo just weeks before the Olympics. His form is peaking at exactly the right time.

**Why he podiums:**
- Defending Olympic classic distance champion — has performed in the biggest moments throughout career
- Classic technique is world-class — the 12.9-second victory over Klaebo at Falun is extraordinary
- 4th relay at these Games created "a bitter taste" — fuels redemption motivation
- Deep experience — 4 Olympics, patient racing style suits 50km
- 2nd in 10km Classic at Oberhof (+13.8s behind Nyenget) — consistent classic form

**Vulnerability:**
- Age (34) and the physical demands of a 50km classic race
- Less explosive than Klaebo in a sprint finish
- Olympic form has been mixed — 17th in skiathlon at these Games

**Prediction:** Podium contender. His classic superiority could overcome Klaebo if conditions favor pure classic ability.

## Contender #4: Harald Oestberg AMUNDSEN (NOR) — BIB 2

**The All-Around Threat**

Amundsen has been Klaebo's most consistent rival this season, winning the Ruka 20km Mass Start and accumulating 32 WC podiums (12 wins). At 27, he is in his physical prime.

**Why he contends:**
- 12 World Cup wins — second only to Klaebo in the overall standings
- Won the Ruka 20km mass start at the season opener — elite mass start racer
- WCH Trondheim 2025: gold, silver, and bronze medals across events
- Strong finishing kick — only Klaebo consistently beats him in sprint finishes

**Vulnerability:**
- Classic technique is not his strongest suit — prefers freestyle events
- Struggled with lung issues during Tour de Ski (9th overall)
- Olympic results at MiCo 2026 have been inconsistent — 4th in 10km free, 6th in skiathlon
- 50km classic may be the event where pure classic specialists have the biggest advantage

**Prediction:** Top-5 almost certain; podium depends on whether the race rewards tactical sprinting or sustained classic power.

## Contender #5: Emil IVERSEN (NOR) — BIB 4

**The Comeback King**

Iversen is the reigning 50km Classic World Champion from Oberstdorf 2021. His comeback from near-oblivion to Olympic selection is one of the stories of the season. He was 2nd in the Goms 20km Classic Mass Start and 5th at the Tour de Ski. His response to being initially dropped from the WC squad — *"Now they can't avoid me"* — encapsulates his warrior mentality.

**Why he contends:**
- Reigning 50km Classic World Champion — proven at this distance and technique
- Classic technique specialist — selected for relay classic leg (which Norway won by 22.2s)
- 2nd at Goms 20km Classic Mass Start demonstrates peak classic form
- Veteran race intelligence over 50km — knows how to pace and when to attack
- Nothing to lose — this is almost certainly his final Olympic event at 34

**Vulnerability:**
- 34 years old with limited recent racing background
- May lack the top-end speed of Klaebo and Amundsen in a sprint finish
- Controversial selection — pressure of proving doubters wrong

**Prediction:** Legitimate top-5 contender. Could challenge for a medal if the race breaks early and rewards classic endurance.
