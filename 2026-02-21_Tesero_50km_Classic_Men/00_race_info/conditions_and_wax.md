## February Weather in Val di Fiemme — General Expectations

Val di Fiemme in mid-to-late February typically experiences:

- **Air temperatures:** Ranging from approximately -5C to +5C, depending on sun exposure and time of day. Morning starts can be cold; temperatures may rise during the 2+ hour race duration.
- **Snow temperatures:** Often slightly below freezing at 900m elevation in February, but warm spells can push snow temperatures near or above 0C, particularly in afternoon sun.
- **Snow conditions:** Typically firm, machine-groomed artificial/natural snow mix. Val di Fiemme has snowmaking capabilities. Late February can bring variable conditions — cold mornings with warming trends.
- **Sunshine:** February days in the Dolomite valleys can be sunny with significant solar radiation, which affects both snow transformation and athlete hydration/heat management over 50km.
- **Wind:** Generally sheltered in the valley, but open sections of the course may experience light to moderate breezes.

## Wax Considerations

> **Status:** [TO BE POPULATED] — Specific wax recommendations will depend on race-day conditions.

### Classic Wax Factors for 50km

- **Kick Wax / Grip Zone:** The 50km classic demands reliable kick wax that lasts the entire race distance (~2+ hours of skiing). Wax durability is paramount. Service teams will need to choose between:
  - Hard wax layers for cold, dry conditions
  - Klister for warm, wet, or icy transformed snow
  - Skin skis as an alternative to traditional wax — increasingly common in the World Cup and may be used by some athletes
- **Glide Wax:** Fluorocarbon wax regulations (FIS ban on high-fluorocarbon wax since 2023-24 season) affect glide preparation. Teams will use compliant glide waxes.
- **Temperature Transitions:** With an 11:00 start and a ~2+ hour race, conditions may change significantly during the event. Snow that is firm and cold at the start can become wet and slow by the finish, especially on sun-exposed sections. Teams must anticipate this transition.
- **Wax Zones:** Athletes may have access to designated wax zones on the course where service personnel can apply fresh kick wax during the race (subject to race rules — to be confirmed for this event).

### Skin Skis vs. Traditional Wax

The use of skin skis (skis with mohair or synthetic grip strips instead of kick wax) has become increasingly prevalent in World Cup classic racing. For a 50km race, the reliability advantage of skin skis is significant — no risk of kick wax wearing off. However, traditional waxed skis can be faster when the wax is perfectly matched to conditions. This strategic choice will be a key storyline.
