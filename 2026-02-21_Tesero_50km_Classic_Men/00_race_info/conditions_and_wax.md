## Weather Forecast
*[DATA NOT FOUND — forecast data to be populated closer to race time or on race day]*

### Typical February Conditions at Tesero (830m elevation)
- **Air Temperature:** Typically -5°C to +5°C in late February
- **Snow Temperature:** Typically -8°C to -2°C at 11:00 start
- **Humidity:** Variable — valley location can trap moisture
- **Wind:** Generally sheltered in the valley, but exposed sections on climbs may have wind
- **Precipitation:** February can bring fresh snow or clear, cold conditions
- **Sun Exposure:** By late February, increasing solar angle can affect snow conditions, particularly on south-facing sections during the 2+ hour race

## Snow Conditions
- **Snowmaking:** The venue has artificial snowmaking systems, ensuring consistent base coverage
- **Grooming:** State-of-the-art grooming equipment; venue is known for excellent classic track preparation
- **Classic Tracks:** Fresh-set classic tracks for the race; track quality is historically very good at this venue

## Wax Considerations for Classic Technique

### Key Factors
1. **50km duration** — Grip wax must last 2+ hours of skiing, which is the paramount wax challenge. Klister or hardwax selection must be durable.
2. **Mass start format** — No opportunity to re-wax during the race. Wax choice is a one-shot decision.
3. **Temperature changes** — Over a 2+ hour race starting at 11:00, conditions can change significantly as the day warms. Wax teams must anticipate conditions at the finish, not just the start.
4. **Elevation variation** — The ~150m of elevation variation on the course means conditions may differ between valley floor sections (warmer) and forested climbs (cooler/shaded).

### Wax Strategy Notes
- **Grip zone wax** is the critical decision — the balance between grip on climbs and glide on flats is the defining wax challenge of a 50km classic race
- **Glide wax** on tips and tails is relatively standard but structure choice (fine vs. coarse) depends heavily on snow crystal type and moisture content
- **Durability over 50km** favors conservative, harder grip wax choices that may sacrifice some initial performance for longevity
- Teams with the best wax technicians (typically Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Italian home team) have a meaningful advantage in a 50km classic race

### Historical Wax Notes from Val di Fiemme
- The venue's reliable artificial snow base combined with potential natural snow overlays can create variable conditions
- Late-season sun in February can cause rapid snow transformation on exposed sections
- The valley floor location can create localized temperature inversions affecting wax performance

## Race Duration Estimate
Based on the 2013 WCH 50km Classical at this venue (won by Johan Olsson in 2:10:41.4), expect a winning time in the range of **2:05:00 - 2:15:00** depending on conditions, field dynamics, and course configuration.
