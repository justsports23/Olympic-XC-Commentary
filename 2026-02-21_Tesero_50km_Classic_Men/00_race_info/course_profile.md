## Course Configuration Notes

The 50km race at Tesero will likely use **multiple laps of a shorter loop** (common configurations include 5 x 10km, 10 x 5km, or a combination of loops). The exact course layout and number of laps will be confirmed in the official FIS technical delegate report and competition information.

Val di Fiemme's cross-country courses are well-known from decades of World Cup, World Championship, and Tour de Ski racing. The terrain features:

- **Rolling terrain** through the Fiemme Valley floor
- **Notable climbs** that test classic technique, particularly diagonal stride
- **Technical descents** with turns that require good balance and ski handling
- **A stadium area** at the Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium with grandstand seating

## Commentary Notes for Course

- **Lap Format Impact:** In a 50km race run over multiple laps, athletes and commentators can track splits and time gaps lap by lap. Breakaway attempts can be monitored more precisely.
- **Altitude (~900m):** Moderate altitude — not a significant factor for acclimatization, but slightly thinner air compared to sea-level venues.
- **Classic Technique on This Course:** The Val di Fiemme courses have historically rewarded strong all-around classic skiers. The climbs demand good diagonal stride, while the flats and rollers reward efficient double poling.
- **Final Alpe Cermis Climb:** The Tour de Ski finale at Val di Fiemme famously includes the Alpe Cermis climb, but this climb is **not** part of the standard stadium course used for World Cup/Olympic distance events. The 50km race will use the Tesero stadium loops.
