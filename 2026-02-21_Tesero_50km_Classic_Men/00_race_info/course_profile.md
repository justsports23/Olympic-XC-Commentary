## Course Characteristics

### Terrain Profile
The Tesero course sits in a valley floor at approximately 830m elevation, with climbs reaching into the surrounding forested hillsides. The course is characterized by:

- **Rolling terrain** with moderately demanding climbs and technical descents
- **Forest sections** through dense coniferous woodland managed by the Magnifica Comunita di Fiemme
- **Valley floor stretches** along the Avisio stream providing faster, flatter segments
- **Stadium area** with spectator grandstands for the start/finish

### Key Technical Features
- **Climbs:** Multiple ascents of 100-140m elevation gain per lap — challenging but not extreme by World Cup standards. The course rewards consistent climbing ability over the full 50km rather than explosive uphill power.
- **Descents:** Technical descents through forest terrain requiring good technique at speed. In mass start conditions, positioning into descents is tactically critical.
- **Classic technique tracks:** The venue has undergone extensive modernization for the 2026 Olympics, including redesigned loops for classical technique. Classic track quality is traditionally excellent at this venue.
- **Stadium finish:** The stadium area accommodates 15,000 spectators with permanent grandstands (installed 2003).

### Course Suitability Profile
This course favors:
- **Strong classic technique** — the rolling terrain requires efficient diagonal stride and double-poling
- **Climbing endurance** — cumulative elevation gain over 50km will be significant (estimated ~1,800-2,000m based on historical data)
- **Tactical racing** — mass start format on a lapped course creates opportunities for pack dynamics, breakaways, and strategic positioning
- **Descending skill** — technical forest descents can create gaps or cause problems in the pack

## Altitude Considerations
At 830m base elevation, altitude is **not a significant factor** for this race. Athletes will not experience meaningful altitude effects, though the mountainous location means temperature and weather conditions can vary during the ~2-hour race duration.

## Snowmaking & Conditions
- **Artificial snowmaking system** covers the course
- **Season:** Typically December through mid-March
- **Snow quality:** The venue has a strong reputation for consistent course preparation, groomed daily with state-of-the-art equipment
- Trails support both classical and skating techniques

## Infrastructure
- **Waxing Facilities:** 20 underground waxing cabins (built for 2026 Olympics)
- **Changing Rooms:** 20 underground rooms (2026 construction)
- **Equipment Storage:** 2,000 sq meter underground garage/depot (established 2013)
- **Biathlon Range:** Standard 50m shooting area with 30 electronic targets
