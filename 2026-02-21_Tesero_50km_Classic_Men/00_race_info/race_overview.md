## Format Description

The Men's 50km Mass Start Classic is a mass start distance race. All competitors start simultaneously from a common start line and race 50 kilometers using the classic technique (diagonal stride, double pole, herringbone — no skating). The first athlete to cross the finish line wins.

This is the longest individual event in the Olympic cross-country skiing program and represents the ultimate test of endurance, classic technique, and tactical acumen in the sport.

## Event Significance

- **The Marathon Event:** The 50km is the flagship endurance event in men's cross-country skiing, analogous to the marathon in athletics. It demands exceptional aerobic capacity, fueling strategy, and mental fortitude over approximately two hours of racing.
- **Traditional Finale:** The men's 50km has historically been the final event on the men's cross-country skiing program at the Olympic Winter Games, serving as the grand finale and culmination of the competition.
- **One of the Most Prestigious Events in Cross-Country Skiing:** Winning the Olympic 50km is considered one of the highest achievements in the sport. The event's history stretches back to the first Winter Olympics in 1924 (as a distance event, though the exact distance and format have varied over the decades).
- **Classic Technique:** The 2026 edition is contested in the classic technique, which rewards athletes with refined traditional skiing mechanics — particularly strong diagonal stride on climbs and efficient double poling on flats and downhills.
- **Mass Start Dynamics:** The mass start format introduces tactical elements — drafting, positioning, pack dynamics, and timing of breakaway attempts — that differ significantly from interval start racing.
