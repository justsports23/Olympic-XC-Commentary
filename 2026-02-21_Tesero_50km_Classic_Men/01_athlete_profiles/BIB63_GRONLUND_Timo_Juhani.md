## Personal Background

Timo Juhani Gronlund has one of the most unusual backstories in the entire Olympic field. Born on July 3, 1987, in Kitee, Finland -- a town in the North Karelia region near the Russian border -- Gronlund grew up in one of the world's great cross-country skiing nations. Finland's tradition in the sport stretches back over a century, and Kitee sits in the heart of Finland's snowy eastern landscape, where winters are long and skiing is a way of life.

But Gronlund's path took a dramatic turn in 2011 when he married a Bolivian woman. By 2013-2014, he had relocated to La Paz, Bolivia -- one of the highest cities in the world at approximately 3,640 meters (11,942 feet) above sea level. Living at extreme altitude in a South American metropolis could not have been more different from the forests and lakes of North Karelia. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timo_Juhani_Gr%C3%B6nlund)

In 2017, Gronlund began competing internationally for Bolivia, making him one of the most distinctive athletes in cross-country skiing: a Finnish-born, Finnish-trained skier racing under the Bolivian flag. Bolivia, a landlocked nation known for its Andean peaks, Amazon rainforest, and salt flats, has virtually no cross-country skiing infrastructure. Gronlund is essentially the entirety of Bolivia's cross-country skiing program.

The decision to compete for Bolivia gave Gronlund access to the Olympic Games through the basic quota system, which allocates spots to nations that otherwise could not qualify based on results. Since 2017, he has represented Bolivia at every major championship, including three consecutive Olympic Games. At PyeongChang 2018, he competed in the men's 15km freestyle. At Beijing 2022, he finished 89th in the 15km classic. And at Milano Cortina 2026, he has already completed the skiathlon (73rd) and will close his Olympic campaign with the 50km. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timo_Juhani_Gr%C3%B6nlund), [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/timo-juhani-gronlund)

At 38, Gronlund is the oldest athlete in the men's 50km field by a significant margin. His Finnish upbringing gave him the technical foundation and skiing culture that underpins his career, while his life in Bolivia has given him a unique story and the altitude acclimatization that comes from living at nearly 4,000 meters. The physiological benefits of altitude living -- increased red blood cell production and oxygen-carrying capacity -- could theoretically be advantageous for endurance events, though the lack of snow training facilities in Bolivia presents obvious challenges. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/56943)

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Finnish training background suggests solid classic technique. Finland's skiing tradition emphasizes classical technique, particularly in the eastern regions.
- **Freestyle strength:** Competed in 15km freestyle at PyeongChang 2018, indicating competence in both techniques.
- **Sprint ability:** [DATA NOT FOUND] -- at 38, sprint events are unlikely to be a focus.
- **Distance preference:** Distance events exclusively. His event selections at three Olympics have all been distance events, culminating in the 50km.
- **Best format:** Individual distance events. The 50km mass start suits his endurance profile.
- **Climbing ability:** Lives at 3,640m altitude in La Paz. The physiological adaptation to extreme altitude could benefit his oxygen-carrying capacity on climbs. Finnish training background also includes hilly terrain.

## 50km/Long Distance Race History
[DATA NOT FOUND] -- At 38 with three Olympic Games and four World Championships, Gronlund has almost certainly raced at or near 50km in past championships. His experience at marathon distance is one of his key assets.

## Key Storylines

### The Oldest Man in the Field
At 38, Gronlund is the senior statesman of the entire 50km field. In a race that demands extreme physical endurance, his age is both a challenge and a testament to his longevity. The 50km at the Olympics is the ultimate test of a distance skier's body, and attempting it at 38 requires deep reserves of fitness and mental toughness.

### From Finnish Forests to Bolivian Altitude
Gronlund's life journey from Kitee, Finland to La Paz, Bolivia is a story of love and adventure that few Olympic athletes can match. He married a Bolivian woman, moved to one of the highest cities on Earth, and then began representing his adopted country at the Winter Olympics. The contrast between Finnish cross-country skiing tradition and Bolivian culture makes him one of the most unique athletes at these Games. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timo_Juhani_Gr%C3%B6nlund)

### Three Consecutive Olympics for Bolivia
Since switching allegiance in 2017, Gronlund has given Bolivia a presence at every Winter Olympics. For a country with no winter sports infrastructure, having a three-time Olympian in cross-country skiing is a remarkable achievement. Gronlund IS Bolivian cross-country skiing.

### Altitude Advantage?
Living at 3,640 meters in La Paz gives Gronlund natural altitude acclimatization. The Tesero course sits at approximately 1,000 meters, meaning Gronlund is racing at much lower altitude than his daily life. While the training disadvantages of living in Bolivia (limited snow access) likely outweigh the altitude benefits, the physiological adaptations from high-altitude living could help him maintain effort over the final kilometers of a 50km race.

### Possibly His Last Olympics
At 38, Gronlund would be 42 at the 2030 Games. While not impossible in cross-country skiing, this is likely his final Olympic appearance. The 50km mass start may be his Olympic farewell -- a fitting ending for a career defined by going the distance, both literally and figuratively.
