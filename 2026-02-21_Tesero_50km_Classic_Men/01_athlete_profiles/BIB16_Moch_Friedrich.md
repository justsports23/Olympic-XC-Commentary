## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Competent but not his primary technique. 7th in 20km C mass start at Les Rousses (2024-25 WC), 12th in 20km C pursuit at Davos (Dec 2023), 5th in 15km C mass start at Val di Fiemme (Jan 2024), 9th in 20km C mass start in Canmore (Feb 2024). Solid classic skier but strongest in freestyle. [Flashscore](https://www.flashscore.com/player/moch-friedrich/ClL6eMHM/)
- **Freestyle strength:** Strong -- all 4 WC podiums came in freestyle events. Dominant pre-season form in freestyle (won 10km freestyle in Muonio). [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/friedrich-moch-superior-at-the-10km-freestyle-race-in-muonio/)
- **Sprint ability:** Limited -- not a sprint specialist
- **Distance preference:** Mid-to-long distance (10-50km)
- **Best format:** Tour de Ski multi-stage, mass start distance events
- **Climbing ability:** EXCEPTIONAL -- all 3 individual WC podiums came on the steep Alpe Cermis final climb (425m elevation gain). This is his defining strength. [Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com/page/friedrich_moch)

## Venue History
Has raced at Val di Fiemme/Tesero multiple times through Tour de Ski stages. Olympic results at Tesero in 2026: 26th skiathlon, 37th 10km free. Tour de Ski Final Climb podiums at Val di Fiemme in 2022, 2024, and 2025. [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/41411)

## Key Storylines
- Known as a climbing specialist -- his exceptional uphill power could be a major asset in the 50km if the course profile is demanding
- All 4 WC podiums came specifically on the Alpe Cermis final climb -- his "one-trick" reputation may be unfair but it defines his profile
- His 50km WCH debut at Trondheim 2025 (15th) was encouraging but that was freestyle, not classic
- The 50km classic mass start is a very different challenge from his Tour de Ski climbing specialty
- Has been disappointing at these Olympics so far (26th skiathlon, 37th 10km free) -- needs a strong finale
- Classic technique is his secondary strength; freestyle/skating is where he excels
- At 25, still young for a 50km race -- typically favors more experienced athletes
