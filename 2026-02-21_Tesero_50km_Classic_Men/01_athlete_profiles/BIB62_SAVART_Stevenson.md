## Personal Background

Stevenson Savart's story is one of the most extraordinary in the history of the Winter Olympics. Born on May 11, 2000, in Delmas, a commune in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area of Haiti, Savart's life changed dramatically when he was adopted at the age of three by Thierry and Sandrine Savart, a French couple who brought him to La Bresse in the Vosges mountains of northeastern France. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/haiti-stevenson-savart-milano-cortina-2026), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenson_Savart)

The Vosges is a region with deep cross-country skiing traditions, and Savart's adoptive parents put him on skis almost immediately after his arrival. Growing up in a community where skiing was a way of life, the young Haitian-French boy fell in love with the sport. As he has recalled, all his school friends were in the same ski club, and there was never really a question about what sport he would pursue. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/haiti-stevenson-savart-milano-cortina-2026)

What makes Savart's story so powerful is his conscious decision to compete for Haiti -- the country of his birth, a Caribbean island nation devastated by earthquakes, political instability, and poverty. Haiti is a country where snow does not fall and winter sports infrastructure does not exist. Yet Savart chose to carry the Haitian flag, to represent his birth country at the highest level of winter sport, and to make history.

> "Athletes from so-called 'exotic' countries can do winter sports without being laughed at. We have to be taken seriously."

This quote, given before the Games, encapsulates Savart's mission: to prove that winter sport is not the exclusive domain of wealthy northern nations, and that athletes from any background can compete with dignity. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/haiti-stevenson-savart-milano-cortina-2026)

In 2015, Savart returned to Haiti with his adoptive family and was able to see his birth mother, brother, sister, and grandmother for the first time since leaving as a toddler. This reconnection with his roots deepened his commitment to representing Haiti on the world stage. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/haiti-stevenson-savart-milano-cortina-2026)

Savart's Olympic debut was celebrated with remarkable warmth. When he crossed the finish line of the skiathlon in 64th place, the crowd in Tesero gave him an ovation that rivaled those for medal winners. The jubilant finish drew widespread media attention, with NBC, Xinhua, and outlets worldwide covering the moment. -- [NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/haitis-first-olympic-cross-country-skier-celebrated-crowd-after-jubilant-finish-mens-skiathlon), [Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20260213/e139365169a5428183a6d941ed2581dd/c.html)

His equipment for the Olympics was purchased with the help of an Olympic Solidarity scholarship, highlighting the financial challenges that athletes from developing nations face. Where Scandinavian skiers have national federations, full-time support staff, and state-of-the-art equipment, Savart has built his career through personal determination and the support of the Olympic movement's solidarity programs. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/haiti-stevenson-savart-milano-cortina-2026)

## Key Storylines

### Haiti's First Olympic Cross-Country Skier
Savart's most fundamental storyline is his historic significance. He is the first Haitian to compete in Olympic cross-country skiing. Every meter he races extends the boundaries of what Haiti has achieved at the Winter Olympics. His presence challenges assumptions about which nations belong in winter sport. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/winter-olympics-2026-stevenson-savart-makes-history-as-haiti-s-first-ever-olympic-cross-country-skier)

### "We Have to Be Taken Seriously"
Savart's pre-Games declaration that athletes from "exotic" countries must be taken seriously in winter sports is a powerful statement about inclusion and representation. His competitive results -- 64th in the skiathlon against the world's best -- back up his words with action. He is not just participating; he is competing. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/haiti-stevenson-savart-milano-cortina-2026)

### From Delmas to the Snow Marathon
The contrast between Delmas, Haiti -- a dense urban commune in the tropical Caribbean -- and the snow-covered mountains of Tesero, Italy, could not be more stark. Savart's journey from one to the other, via adoption and the Vosges, is a human story that transcends sport.

### The Crowd's Favorite
Savart's skiathlon finish drew one of the loudest ovations of the Games. The Tesero crowd embraced the Haitian skier, recognizing the magnitude of what he was achieving. The 50km finish, should he complete the race, will almost certainly produce a similar outpouring of support. -- [NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/haitis-first-olympic-cross-country-skier-celebrated-crowd-after-jubilant-finish-mens-skiathlon), [Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20260213/e139365169a5428183a6d941ed2581dd/c.html)

### Olympic Solidarity and the Dream of Access
Savart purchased his Olympic equipment with a scholarship from the Olympic Solidarity program, which supports athletes from nations with limited sports infrastructure. His story highlights both the importance of these programs and the financial barriers that prevent talented athletes from developing nations from reaching their potential.

### Reconnecting with Haiti
Savart's 2015 visit to Haiti to see his birth family adds an emotional dimension to his representation of the country. He carries not just a flag but a personal connection to the nation he represents.
