**Season summary:** Drahun has been Ukraine's leading male cross-country skier heading into these Games. His Olympic results so far -- 59th in the skiathlon and 60th in the sprint qualification -- are respectable given the immense challenges Ukrainian athletes face in preparing for international competition during wartime. His career-best World Cup result of 18th, achieved in better times, shows he has the talent to compete at a higher level. -- [Glavnoe](https://glavnoe.in.ua/en/news-en/ukraine-names-its-cross-country-and-skiing-team-for-the-2026-winter-olympics)

## Personal Background

Dmytro Drahun is a Ukrainian cross-country skier competing at his first Olympic Games under the most extraordinary of circumstances. Born on December 30, 1997, Drahun has been training and competing while his country endures the devastating impact of the Russian invasion that began in February 2022.

Ukrainian winter sports athletes have faced unimaginable hardships since the war began. Training facilities have been damaged or destroyed, funding has been redirected to defense needs, and the psychological toll of competing while one's country is under attack is incalculable. Ukraine's young skiers practice in bombed-out Olympic training bases, with sessions interrupted by air raid sirens and the sound of drones overhead. About 350 kids and teens -- some of the nation's best young cross-country skiers and biathletes -- still practice in fenced-off areas amid sporadic explosions. Many Ukrainians view training for these events as an act of defiance against the invasion. -- [ABC News/AP](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/ukraines-young-skiers-practice-bombed-olympic-training-base-129277371), [Morning Journal](https://www.morningjournal.com/2026/01/16/russia-ukraine-war-olympics/)

Drahun's career-best World Cup result of 18th was likely achieved before the war, when Ukrainian athletes had access to proper training infrastructure and could compete without the constant weight of their nation's suffering. That he is still racing at the Olympic level -- and still capable of finishing in the top 60 against the world's best -- is a testament to extraordinary resilience.

Ukraine's cross-country team for the 2026 Olympics includes Drahun alongside Oleksandr Lisohor (who is also in the 50km field, BIB 44) and several women's team members. -- [Glavnoe](https://glavnoe.in.ua/en/news-en/ukraine-names-its-cross-country-and-skiing-team-for-the-2026-winter-olympics)

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Solid. His career-best 18th at World Cup level and selection for the 50km classic mass start indicate strong classic skiing ability.
- **Freestyle strength:** Capable. His skiathlon result (59th) requires competence in both techniques.
- **Sprint ability:** Limited at elite level -- 60th in Olympic sprint qualification, though this is secondary to his distance strength.
- **Distance preference:** Distance specialist. His 18th-place career-best suggests peak performance in individual distance events.
- **Best format:** Individual distance events and relay, based on his career-best results.
- **Climbing ability:** [DATA NOT FOUND]

## 50km/Long Distance Race History
[DATA NOT FOUND] -- Drahun's 18th-place career-best at World Cup level suggests he has the fitness and technique for marathon-distance racing. His challenge will be maintaining pace over 50km given the training disruptions caused by wartime conditions.

## Key Storylines

### Competing for a Country at War
Drahun's most powerful storyline is that he competes for Ukraine while his country endures an ongoing war. Every start he makes, every kilometer he races, carries the weight of representing a nation fighting for its existence. Ukrainian athletes at these Olympics are not just competing for medals -- they are carrying the spirit and determination of their people onto the world stage. -- [ABC News/AP](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/ukraines-young-skiers-practice-bombed-olympic-training-base-129277371)

### Training in a War Zone
The reality of training for an Olympic 50km race while your country is being invaded is almost incomprehensible. Ukrainian skiers have trained in facilities damaged by missile strikes, with sessions interrupted by air raid sirens. The mental fortitude required to maintain world-class fitness under these conditions is staggering. -- [Morning Journal](https://www.morningjournal.com/2026/01/16/russia-ukraine-war-olympics/)

### Unrealized Potential
Drahun's career-best of 18th at World Cup level hints at what might have been without the disruption of war. At 28, he should be in his competitive prime, but the circumstances have made it impossible to reach his full potential. The 50km provides one more chance to show the world what Ukrainian athletes are capable of.

### Four-Time World Championship Veteran
With four World Championships under his belt since 2019, Drahun brings genuine big-race experience to the 50km start line. His relay result of 14th at the 2019 Worlds shows he has performed at a high level in major championships when conditions allowed.

### Teammates in the Field
Drahun is not alone in the 50km field -- his Ukrainian teammate Oleksandr Lisohor (BIB 44) is also racing. The two can draw strength from each other in what will be a long and demanding race.
