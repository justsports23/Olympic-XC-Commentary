**Season summary:** Stephen's first Olympic Games have exceeded all expectations. After winning the Canadian trials despite returning from a back injury just days before, he delivered a career-best 9th in the 10km freestyle -- temporarily holding the lead -- and then anchored Canada's historic 5th-place relay. At just 23, he has announced himself as the future of Canadian men's cross-country skiing. Now faces the daunting challenge of the 50km mass start classic -- by far the longest race of his career.

## Personal Background

Tom Stephen grew up in Calgary, Alberta, and started cross-country skiing at age 10, following his older sister into the sport. He is currently pursuing an engineering degree at the University of Calgary while competing internationally. -- [Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/tom-stephen/)

Stephen credits watching Alex Harvey compete as a major inspiration and lists former Olympian Jesse Cockney -- now one of his coaches -- as a role model. He is described as the first Canadian male to ever win a gold medal at the Nordic Junior World Ski Championships, though the specific event details require further verification. -- [Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/tom-stephen/)

His favorite quote: *"Stressed spelled backwards is desserts."* -- [Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/tom-stephen/)

Outside of skiing, Stephen is an avid fly fisherman. -- [Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/tom-stephen/)

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Developing. Won Canadian Olympic Trials 10km classic. His U23 Worlds 5th in 20km mass start classic suggests solid classic ability for his age. The 50km classic will be the ultimate test.
- **Freestyle strength:** Strong and possibly his stronger technique. His Olympic 9th in 10km freestyle was a career-defining result.
- **Sprint ability:** [DATA NOT FOUND for sprint-specific results]
- **Distance preference:** Appears to favor middle distances (10-20km). The 50km is a significant step up from anything he has raced competitively.
- **Best format:** Interval start (career best came in interval format at Olympics). Mass start experience limited.
- **Climbing ability:** [DATA NOT FOUND]

## 50km/Long Distance Race History
[DATA NOT FOUND for specific 50km or marathon distance results. His longest confirmed competitive race is the 20km mass start classic at U23 Worlds (5th place). The 50km represents uncharted territory for this 23-year-old.]

## Key Storylines

### Canada's Breakthrough Generation
Stephen is part of a golden generation of Canadian cross-country skiers -- alongside Xavier McKeever, Antoine Cyr, and Remi Drolet -- who have been teammates since their junior relay silver in 2020. Their 5th-place Olympic relay was described as Canada's best-ever result and a sign of a program on the rise. -- [Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/2026/02/15/something-special-team-canada-earns-best-ever-olympic-result-in-cross-country-skiing-relay/)

### The Leader's Chair
Stephen's 9th-place Olympic finish in the 10km freestyle was remarkable enough, but the moment he sat in the leader's chair -- temporarily the fastest man on the course -- became an iconic image of these Games for Canada. For a 23-year-old at his first Olympics, it was a "didn't know I had that in me" breakthrough. -- [Rocky Mountain News](https://www.rmoutlook.com/2026-olympics/canadian-skier-tom-stephen-scores-career-best-9th-at-milano-cortina-2026-11876674)

### Back Injury Comeback
Stephen had to deal with a back injury heading into the Olympic season, returning to snow only 10 days before the Canadian trials. That he won the trials and then delivered career-best performances at the Olympics speaks to his mental resilience and raw talent. -- [Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/tom-stephen/)

### Youth in the 50km
At 23, Stephen is one of the youngest athletes in the 50km field. The 50km mass start classic is traditionally a veteran's race -- a grueling test of endurance, fueling, and race craft over 2+ hours. Stephen's youthful energy could be an asset, but his inexperience at this distance is a significant unknown.

### Engineering the Perfect Race
An engineering student at the University of Calgary, Stephen brings an analytical mindset to his racing. Balancing academics with elite sport, he represents the student-athlete model that is increasingly common in North American skiing.
