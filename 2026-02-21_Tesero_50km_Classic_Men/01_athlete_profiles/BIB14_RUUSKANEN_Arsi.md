## Personal Background

Arsi Ruuskanen is a 26-year-old Finnish distance skier from Siilinjärvi, a municipality in the Northern Savonia region of Finland, near the city of Kuopio — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsi_Ruuskanen). Growing up in the Finnish lake district heartland of Nordic skiing, Ruuskanen developed through the Finnish junior and U23 pipeline before breaking through at the highest level.

His career-defining moment came at the 2022 Junior and U23 World Championships in Lygna, Norway, where he won gold in the U23 men's 15km classic race — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/arsi-ruuskanen-gold-at-the-u23-world-ski-championships/). That victory signaled his transition from a promising development athlete to a genuine senior-level contender.

Ruuskanen was selected for the Finnish national team for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 seasons — [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/ski-team-selection-25-26). He earned his Olympic selection alongside Finnish distance skiing legends like Iivo Niskanen, marking a generational transition in Finnish men's cross-country skiing — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-nordic-combined-finlands-johanna-matintalo-arsi-ruuskanen-and-eero-hirvonen-selected-for-the-olympic-games-in-milan-cortina-1219/).

**Season summary:** Ruuskanen has posted solid if not spectacular results in the 2025-26 season, with consistent top-20 finishes in distance events.

## Key Storylines

1. **Finland's distance future:** Ruuskanen represents the next generation of Finnish distance skiing after the era of Iivo Niskanen. Racing alongside the veteran in the relay (where Finland finished 4th) and now in the 50km, Ruuskanen is establishing himself as Finland's primary distance hope for the coming Olympic cycle.

2. **4th in the relay — so close to a medal:** Finland's agonizing 4th-place relay finish means Ruuskanen enters the 50km with the bittersweet experience of nearly medaling. Norway won gold, France took silver, and Italy claimed bronze, leaving Finland just off the podium — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/norway-powers-to-mens-4x7-5km-relay-gold-at-milano-cortina-2026/).

3. **50km experience from Trondheim:** Unlike many athletes in this field, Ruuskanen has recent 50km championship experience. His 14th place at the 2025 WCH in Trondheim means he knows what the final 20km of a 50km race feels like at the highest level. That experience is invaluable.

4. **U23 classic champion:** His 2022 U23 World Championship gold in the 15km classic at Lygna showed early that Ruuskanen had world-class classic technique. Today's 50km classic race is the ultimate test of that ability.

5. **Consistent season form:** His 15th at Trondheim WC (+11.4s) and 11th in the Olympic skiathlon show Ruuskanen racing at a steady, high level without dramatic peaks or valleys. In a 50km race that punishes inconsistency, that metronomic consistency could be an asset.

6. **From Siilinjärvi to the Olympic marathon:** Siilinjärvi, his hometown in central Finland, is a small community where Ruuskanen first learned to ski. Representing Finland in the Olympic 50km — the most prestigious distance event — is the culmination of a journey from provincial Finnish skiing to the world stage.
