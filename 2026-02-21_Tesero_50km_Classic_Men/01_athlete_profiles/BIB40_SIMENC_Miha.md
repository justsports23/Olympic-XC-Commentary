**Season summary:** Simenc is the veteran leader of Slovenian cross-country skiing, competing in his third Olympics. His results at MiCo 2026 so far (31st sprint, 51st 10km) are mid-pack but reflect his versatility -- few athletes in this 50km field also contest the sprint. The 50km mass start classic is where his experience and grinding ability could produce a stronger result than the shorter events suggest.

## Personal Background

Miha Simenc was born on 21 December 1995 and is based in Logatec, Slovenia, where he races for TSK Logatec. He is the senior leader of Slovenian cross-country skiing and has been a constant presence on the national team for over a decade. -- [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-slovenia-unveils-its-training-squad-for-the-2025-2026-season-0602/)

For the 2025-26 season, Simenc is part of Slovenia's A-team alongside Eva Urevc, Anja Mandeljc, Nejc Stern, and Vili Crv. The Slovenian cross-country skiing program is small but competitive, regularly punching above its weight at World Cup events. -- [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-slovenia-unveils-its-training-squad-for-the-2025-2026-season-0602/)

Slovenia has a proud skiing tradition centered around Planica -- one of the world's iconic ski jumping venues -- but cross-country skiing receives less domestic attention. Athletes like Simenc help maintain the nation's presence in Nordic skiing at the highest level.

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Competent. Sprint classic 31st at the Olympics shows he can race in classic at this level. His versatility across sprint and distance in classic is unusual.
- **Freestyle strength:** Moderate. 10km freestyle 51st at the Olympics suggests freestyle is not his strongest technique.
- **Sprint ability:** Strong for a 50km entrant. His WC career has included numerous sprint results, with top-10 finishes in World Cup sprint/team sprint events. This is rare for someone entering the 50km. -- [The Sports](https://www.the-sports.org/miha-simenc-cross-country-skiing-spf263729.html)
- **Distance preference:** Versatile -- competes across sprint, 10km, 15km, 30km mass start, skiathlon, and relay formats. His breadth of race entries suggests he is a genuine all-rounder rather than a specialist.
- **Best format:** Sprint and team sprint appear to be his strongest formats historically, but his selection for the 50km suggests the Slovenian team believes he can be competitive over the full distance.
- **Climbing ability:** [DATA NOT FOUND]

## 50km/Long Distance Race History
[DATA NOT FOUND for specific 50km results. However, his competition profile includes 30km mass start entries, which demonstrates experience in longer-distance racing.]

## Key Storylines

### Slovenia's Iron Man
Simenc is the last man standing in the 50km start list -- BIB 40, the final starter. At his third Olympics, he is Slovenia's standard-bearer in what could be his final major championship event. The 50km is a fitting capstone for an athlete who has contested everything from sprint to long distance across a 14-year international career.

### The All-Rounder in a Specialist's Race
Unlike most athletes in the 50km field -- who tend to be either distance specialists or sprint specialists taking a gamble -- Simenc is a genuine all-rounder. He has World Cup sprint results and distance mass start experience. This breadth of racing could be an advantage in the tactical first half of a mass start 50km, where reading the race and conserving energy require the kind of race intelligence that comes from competing across all formats.

### Three Olympics, One Goal
PyeongChang, Beijing, Milano Cortina -- Simenc has been a consistent presence at the Winter Olympics without a breakthrough result. The 50km, with its inherent unpredictability (weather, waxing, attrition over 2+ hours), offers the kind of conditions where an experienced all-rounder can outperform his ranking.

### TSK Logatec's Finest
Representing TSK Logatec, Simenc is a product of Slovenia's club-based skiing development system. His longevity and consistency at the international level -- competing since 2012 -- is a testament to that system and to his personal dedication to the sport.

### Equipment Story
Simenc races on Atomic skis with Alpina boots and One Way poles -- a relatively unusual equipment combination at the elite level, where Fischer and Salomon dominate. The waxing and ski preparation for a 50km classic race is one of the most critical technical elements, and his equipment choices may be significant. -- [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-slovenia-unveils-its-training-squad-for-the-2025-2026-season-0602/)
