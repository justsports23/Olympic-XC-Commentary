## Key Storylines

### Latvia's Cross-Country Flag-Bearer
Raimo Vigants is the face of Latvian men's cross-country skiing. Latvia, a Baltic nation of just two million people, has a proud but small Nordic skiing tradition. Vigants has single-handedly elevated the program's visibility through five World Championship appearances and now two Olympic Games. His career-best 14th at a World Cup race represents one of the finest individual results ever achieved by a Latvian cross-country skier. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/raimo-vigants)

### Biggest-Ever Latvian Winter Olympic Team
Vigants was part of Latvia's largest-ever Winter Olympic delegation, a milestone that reflects the country's growing investment in winter sports. His selection was never in doubt -- he is the clear number one in the men's distance program. -- [LSM.lv](https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/sport/20.01.2026-biggest-ever-latvian-winter-olympic-team-picked.a630669/)

### 50km Veteran
Unlike many athletes in the field for whom the 50km is unfamiliar territory, Vigants has raced 50km at the Olympic level (Beijing 2022) and at the World Championships (Trondheim 2025). This experience is invaluable -- he knows how to manage pacing, nutrition, and the physical demands of ultra-distance racing at the highest level.

### Birthday Race Week
Like his bib neighbor Vili Crv, Vigants celebrates his birthday on February 25 -- just days after the 50km. At 26, he is in the prime of his distance career and has the experience and fitness to deliver his best Olympic result in this event.

### The Career-Best 14th
Vigants' career-best 14th on the World Cup circuit is a remarkable achievement. For context, Latvia has no significant cross-country infrastructure compared to Scandinavian nations, and reaching the top 15 at a World Cup requires competing against the full depth of Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, and Russian athletes. This result marks Vigants as a genuine threat to crack the top 20 on any given day.
