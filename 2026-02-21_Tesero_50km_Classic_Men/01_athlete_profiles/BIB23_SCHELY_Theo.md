## Key Storylines

### First Olympics with Relay Silver
Schely's first Olympic Games have been a dream -- winning relay silver, which he described as having "a special flavour" after overcoming career setbacks. The 50km represents a chance to add an individual result to his Olympic highlight reel.

### French Distance Classic Specialist
One of four Frenchmen selected for the 50km classic (alongside Mathis Desloges, Hugo Lapalus, and Victor Lovera). France's depth in distance classic events has been growing, and Schely's 9th at Planica 2023 WCH in the same event format makes him a legitimate top-15 contender. -- [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-with-mathis-desloges-and-hugo-lapalus-the-four-frenchmen-selected-for-the-50-km-classic-0220/)

### Long Distance Pedigree
Winner of Les Belles Combes marathon in 2023, demonstrating the endurance and long-distance classic ability needed for the 50km. French Cup dominance (1st overall) confirms his status as France's most consistent male distance skier this season.
