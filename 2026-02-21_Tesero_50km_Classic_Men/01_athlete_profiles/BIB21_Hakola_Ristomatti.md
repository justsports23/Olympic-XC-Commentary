## Key Storylines
- SPRINT SPECIALIST IN THE MARATHON: Perhaps the most dramatic distance mismatch in this field. A career sprint specialist taking on 50 kilometers.
- FINNISH CHAMPION: Won THREE gold medals at Finnish Championships in January 2026 (10km classic, skiathlon, team sprint) — his classic form is undeniable, even if the distance is an unknown
- TEAM SPRINT SILVER: WCH 2025 team sprint classic silver (with Vuorinen) shows his classic speed at the highest level
- POSSIBLE FINAL SEASON: At 34, has been mulling retirement. Said it's "51% chance I'll retire and 49% that I'll continue" — this could be his Olympic farewell race [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/half-the-national-team-considering-retirement/)
- The Finnish team clearly values his experience and classic technique enough to select him for the 50km
- If he can manage his effort over 50km, his classic technique and tactical experience from sprinting could be assets in the final kilometers
- Running alongside Finnish legend Iivo Niskanen in Finland's 50km squad — can he learn from the master distance racer?
