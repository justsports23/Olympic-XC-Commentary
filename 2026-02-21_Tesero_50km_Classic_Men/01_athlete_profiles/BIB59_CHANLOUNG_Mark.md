## Personal Background

Mark Chanloung has one of the most fascinating dual-identity stories in the entire Olympic field. Born on February 9, 1995, in Gressoney-La-Trinite -- a picturesque village in the Aosta Valley of northwestern Italy, just south of the Monte Rosa massif -- Chanloung grew up in one of Italy's traditional Alpine communities. His mother, Maria Vittoria Comune, is Italian and works as a physiotherapist. His father, Boonchan Chanloung, is from Chanthaburi province in Thailand and serves as the family's team manager and technical lead. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/thailand-chanloung-siblings-home-milano-cortina-2026), [Olympics.com Athlete365](https://www.olympics.com/athlete365/news/milano-cortina2026/karen-and-mark-chanloung-skiing-siblings-putting-thailand-on-the-map/)

Mark and his sister Karen progressed through Italy's highly competitive youth skiing system before making a life-changing decision in 2016: to switch their sporting allegiance from Italy to Thailand, their father's home country. The move was driven by love for their Thai heritage and a desire to represent the country on the global stage. While they might have struggled to break into Italy's incredibly deep talent pool, competing for Thailand gave them the opportunity to carry a flag, inspire a nation, and put Thai winter sports on the map. -- [Nation Thailand](https://www.nationthailand.com/blogs/news/sport/40046192), [Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/3185390/thailands-skiing-siblings-return-home-for-winter-games)

The Chanloung siblings have now represented Thailand at three consecutive Winter Olympics -- PyeongChang 2018, Beijing 2022, and Milano Cortina 2026. At Beijing, Mark entered four events, the most of any Thai competitor, with his best result being a remarkable 49th in the 50km mass start freestyle. For a nation of 70 million people in tropical Southeast Asia, having consistent representation in one of winter sports' most demanding events is extraordinary. -- [Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20250208/03eb9c59a1cf47aea8dd04f8f02219df/c.html)

The 2026 Games hold special significance for the Chanloung family because they are being held in Italy -- effectively a home Games for athletes who grew up in the Aosta Valley. The Chanloungs have family and friends in the region, and the proximity of the venues to their childhood home adds an emotional dimension to their Olympic experience. As the family put it, they are "feeling right at home" at Milano Cortina 2026. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/thailand-chanloung-siblings-home-milano-cortina-2026)

Beyond his own racing, Mark has embraced a mentorship role, guiding younger Thai athletes who are entering the sport. He has become an idol for aspiring Thai skiers and takes responsibility for developing winter sports in Thailand seriously. His father Boonchan has also been instrumental in building the infrastructure of Thai cross-country skiing from scratch. -- [Olympics.com Athlete365](https://www.olympics.com/athlete365/news/milano-cortina2026/karen-and-mark-chanloung-skiing-siblings-putting-thailand-on-the-map/), [Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20250208/03eb9c59a1cf47aea8dd04f8f02219df/c.html)

## Key Storylines

### The Italian-Thai Family That Conquered Winter Sports
The Chanloung story is one of the great family narratives at these Olympics. An Italian mother, a Thai father, two children who grew up skiing in the Alps, and a decision to represent Thailand that changed the trajectory of an entire country's winter sports program. Their story transcends sport and touches on identity, heritage, and the universal language of athletic competition. -- [Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/3185390/thailands-skiing-siblings-return-home-for-winter-games)

### A Home Games for Thailand -- In Italy
The irony of Thailand's Winter Olympic athletes competing in a "home Games" in Italy is not lost on anyone. Mark grew up in Gressoney-La-Trinite, just hours from the Olympic venues. Racing on familiar Italian snow, in front of fans who may have watched him grow up, adds an emotional layer to his third Olympic appearance. -- [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/thailand-chanloung-siblings-home-milano-cortina-2026)

### Three-Time Olympian and Thai Pioneer
Chanloung has been Thailand's flagbearer at the Milano Cortina Opening Ceremony alongside his sister Karen. Three consecutive Winter Olympics is a feat that very few athletes from non-traditional winter sports nations achieve. His longevity and dedication have made him an institution in Thai winter sports. -- [Nation Thailand](https://www.nationthailand.com/blogs/news/sport/40061835)

### The Mentor
Beyond his own racing, Mark's role as a mentor to young Thai skiers gives his career a significance that extends far beyond his individual results. He is building the foundation for a future generation of Thai winter sports athletes, potentially inspiring competitors who may one day challenge for results he can only dream of. -- [Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20250208/03eb9c59a1cf47aea8dd04f8f02219df/c.html)

### Can He Beat His Beijing Best?
Mark's 49th in the 50km at Beijing 2022 is his Olympic benchmark. Can he improve on that result in Tesero? The switch from freestyle (Beijing) to classic (Milano Cortina) technique adds uncertainty, but his experience and the emotional boost of a quasi-home Games could push him to a career-best Olympic performance.
