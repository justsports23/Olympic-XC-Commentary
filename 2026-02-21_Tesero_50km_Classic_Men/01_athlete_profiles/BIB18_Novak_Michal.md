## Key Storylines
- Sprint specialist entering the longest race in cross-country skiing — a massive step outside his comfort zone
- Recovering from appendicitis surgery in September 2025 that cost him the season start
- His classic technique is genuinely strong (4th WCH sprint classic, working with Norwegian technique coach)
- The Czech Republic's best cross-country skier — carries national expectations
- His 2023 Ruka WC podium ended a 10-year Czech drought on WC podiums
- At 29, in his prime years but the 50km distance may simply be too far for a sprint-oriented skier
- Has shown improving distance ability (20th at these Olympics) but 50km classic is another level entirely
