## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Competent — 32nd in 20km classic pursuit at Tour de Ski (his best TdS result of the week, suggesting classic may be slightly stronger). Data limited.
- **Freestyle strength:** Moderate — WC results include freestyle events but typically in the 28th-54th range
- **Sprint ability:** Limited in individual sprints. Best results are in team sprint format.
- **Distance preference:** Distance specialist — competes across 10km, 15km, 20km, and 50km. The longer the better appears to be his profile.
- **Best format:** Distance mass start events — his 19th in WCH 50km suggests he excels at longer distances
- **Climbing ability:** [DATA NOT FOUND]

## Venue History
Competing at Tesero for the first time at the 2026 Olympics: 38th skiathlon, 28th 10km freestyle. Has competed at Val di Fiemme/Toblach through Tour de Ski stages. [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/18917)

## Key Storylines
- ESTONIAN FLAG BEARER: One of Estonia's top cross-country skiers, carrying national pride in a sport important to Estonian sporting identity
- 50km PEDIGREE: His 19th at WCH Trondheim 2025 in the 50km is a genuine highlight — he belongs at this distance
- DISTANCE SPECIALIST: Unlike some others in this field, the 50km distance suits his profile. His results tend to improve with distance.
- AT 32, entering his mature years — veteran experience in managing a long race
- Realistic goal is a top-25 finish; his WCH 19th shows he can compete at this level in marathon events
- The switch from freestyle 50km (WCH Trondheim) to classic 50km is a significant factor — classic may not be his stronger technique
- Career spanning from 2011 junior competitions through 2026 Olympics — sustained international career
