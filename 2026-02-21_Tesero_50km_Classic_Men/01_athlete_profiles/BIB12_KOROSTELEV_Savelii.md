## Personal Background

Savelii Korostelev is one of the most fascinating stories in cross-country skiing. Born on 30 November 2003 in Perm, Russia, the 22-year-old comes from an extraordinary athletic family. His mother, Natalia Korosteleva, won a bronze medal in the team sprint at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-who-is-saveliy-korostelev-the-russian-cross-country-skier-who-could-compete-in-the-milan-cortina-2026-olympic-games-1210/). His uncle, Nikolai Morilov, also won bronze at those same Games — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-who-is-saveliy-korostelev-the-russian-cross-country-skier-who-could-compete-in-the-milan-cortina-2026-olympic-games-1210/).

Korostelev graduated from a Physics and Mathematics Lyceum, an academic background that, according to him, helps with the analytical demands of competitive skiing — [Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032252/iuliia-fokina/daring-skier-how-savely-korostelev-made-his-way-international-starts-and-2026-olympics). He quickly established himself among the leaders of Russian ski racing, winning the Cup of Russia in the 2024-25 season — [Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032252/iuliia-fokina/daring-skier-how-savely-korostelev-made-his-way-international-starts-and-2026-olympics).

His path to international competition was anything but straightforward. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 — just days after his triumphant Junior World Championship performance at Lygna — Russian athletes were banned from FIS competition. In December 2025, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that Russians meeting IOC neutrality criteria must be allowed to compete, and Korostelev was among 17 athletes granted neutral status — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-who-is-saveliy-korostelev-the-russian-cross-country-skier-who-could-compete-in-the-milan-cortina-2026-olympic-games-1210/). However, an investigation by the Barents Observer revealed that Korostelev has links to Russia's armed forces, adding controversy to his participation — [Barents Observer](https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/news/olympic-hopeful-savelii-korostelev-has-link-to-russias-armed-forces/441946).

| 4 Jan 2026 | Tour de Ski Overall | — | — | Overall | **8th** (+2:28 behind Klaebo) | — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-fresh-from-his-debut-on-the-international-circuit-young-russian-saveliy-korostelev-finishes-top-10-overall-in-the-tour-de-ski-0104/) |

**Season summary:** Korostelev's debut international season since 2022 has been remarkably impressive. After a shaky start at Davos (53rd in sprint), he found his footing during the Tour de Ski, finishing 8th overall and 4th on the grueling Alpe Cermis final climb. His rise through the Tour de Ski stages — from 9th to 12th to 4th — demonstrated the kind of endurance that makes him dangerous in the 50km.

## Skiathlon Incident: Amundsen Collision

During the Olympic skiathlon on 8 February 2026, Korostelev was involved in a notable incident with Norway's Harald Oestberg Amundsen. According to NRK, Korostelev hit the Norwegian with his arm as Amundsen was about to lose his balance. Amundsen ultimately finished 6th. Korostelev expressed remorse, saying: "I'm really sorry for him" — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-what-happened-between-norways-harald-oestberg-amundsen-and-russias-saveliy-korostelev-0208/).

Additionally, after the skiathlon, AIN filed a formal protest arguing that silver medalist Mathis Desloges of France had cut the course in the stadium, which should have resulted in disqualification and elevated Korostelev to the bronze medal. The jury rejected the protest — [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/a-familiar-king-klaebo-opens-milano-cortina-with-skiathlon-gold/).

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Strong. Won JWC 10km classic gold at Lygna. His 9th place in the Tour de Ski 10km classic stage confirms high-level classic technique — [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=CC&raceid=40963)

- **Sprint ability:** Limited at World Cup level (53rd at Davos). Not a natural sprinter.
- **Distance preference:** Distance specialist. Best results are in multi-stage and longer individual events.
- **Best format:** Mass start and multi-day stage races. His Tour de Ski progression and skiathlon 4th show he thrives over longer formats.
- **Climbing ability:** Strong climber — 4th on the Alpe Cermis final climb at Tour de Ski suggests excellent uphill capacity — [Pravda](https://news-pravda.com/world/2026/01/05/1976189.html)

## 50km/Long Distance Race History
Korostelev has no known 50km race results at the elite international level. During his ban from FIS competition (2022-2025), he raced domestically in Russia, where the Cup of Russia series includes long-distance events, but specific 50km results are not publicly available. At 22, this will be his first major international 50km race.

## Venue History (Val di Fiemme / Tesero)
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-------|
| 3-4 Jan 2026 | Tour de Ski (Val di Fiemme stages) | Sprint + 10km MS Free | QF / 4th | 4th on Alpe Cermis — [Pravda](https://news-pravda.com/world/2026/01/05/1976189.html) |
| 8 Feb 2026 | Olympics | 20km Skiathlon | 4th | Tesero — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/klaebo-dominates-20km-skiathlon-at-milano-cortina-2026/) |

Korostelev has meaningful racing experience at this venue, having competed in both the Tour de Ski finale at Val di Fiemme and the Olympic skiathlon at Tesero. His 4th-place skiathlon result shows he can perform well on this course.

## Key Storylines

1. **The most controversial athlete in the field:** Korostelev's presence at the Olympics is a story that transcends sport. Competing as a neutral athlete under the AIN designation after Russia's FIS ban, with reported links to Russia's armed forces — [Barents Observer](https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/news/olympic-hopeful-savelii-korostelev-has-link-to-russias-armed-forces/441946) — his participation has drawn significant scrutiny and media attention.

2. **Three lost years, now a contender:** Korostelev was just 18 when he won double gold at the 2022 Junior World Championships in Lygna. Days later, Russia invaded Ukraine, and he was locked out of international competition for nearly three years. Now 22, he has returned to the world stage and immediately shown he belongs among the best.

3. **4th in the skiathlon — medal hunger:** His agonizing 4th-place finish in the skiathlon, followed by a rejected protest for bronze, means Korostelev enters the 50km with unfinished business. He knows he is capable of medaling at these Games.

4. **Family legacy:** With an Olympic bronze medalist mother (Natalia Korosteleva) and an Olympic bronze medalist uncle (Nikolai Morilov), Korostelev carries a rich skiing heritage and understands what it takes to perform at the highest level — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-who-is-saveliy-korostelev-the-russian-cross-country-skier-who-could-compete-in-the-milan-cortina-2026-olympic-games-1210/).

5. **Youngest contender with distance pedigree:** At 22, Korostelev is one of the youngest athletes in the 50km field, but his Tour de Ski 8th overall and strong climbing ability suggest he has the endurance engine for the longest race in cross-country skiing.

6. **Tour de Ski trajectory:** His progression through the Tour de Ski — improving from 9th to 4th across the stages — is the calling card of a born distance racer. The 50km rewards athletes who get stronger as the race goes on.
