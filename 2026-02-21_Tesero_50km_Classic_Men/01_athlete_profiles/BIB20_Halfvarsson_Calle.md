Halfvarsson was OUT of the Swedish national team for much of the early season and was only selected for the World Cup for the first time this winter in mid-January, just days before the Olympic qualification deadline. His 6th place in the 10km classic at Oberhof was described as showing "a completely new level compared to earlier in the season" — a remarkable late-season surge to earn Olympic selection.

## Key Storylines
- THE ELDER STATESMAN: At 36, the oldest skier in this bib range. Four-time Olympian with 13+ years of World Cup racing
- COMEBACK STORY: Was dropped from the Swedish national team early this season. Fought his way back in mid-January with a stunning 6th in Oberhof classic. Selected for the Olympics only days before the deadline.
- 50km CLASSIC PEDIGREE: His 5th at WCH Planica 2023 in the 50km classic mass start (0.4 sec from a medal!) is the best 50km result of anyone in this bib range
- HIS LAST DANCE? At 36, this could be his final Olympic race. The 50km is the traditional farewell event for veterans.
- Relay silver at WCH 2013 at THIS VENUE (Val di Fiemme) — the venue holds special meaning
- Classic strength is genuine — wins in classic at World Cup level
- The question is fitness: can a 36-year-old who was not even on the national team 5 weeks ago sustain elite output for 50km?
- 27+ career WC podiums and 4 Olympics make him by far the most decorated skier in this group
