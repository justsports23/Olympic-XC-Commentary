## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Strong. His 10th in the 20km classic mass start at Goms (Jan 2026) demonstrates high-level classic ability. Swiss distance tradition (successor to Dario Cologna) emphasizes classic technique.
- **Freestyle strength:** Good. Capable in both techniques -- competes across all distance events in both classic and free.
- **Sprint ability:** Limited at WC level, though he was 4th in U23 WCH sprint. Not a factor in senior sprint events.
- **Distance preference:** Long distance specialist. Competes in 10km, 15km, 20km, 30km, and 50km events. His 5th overall Tour de Ski finish demonstrates multi-day endurance.
- **Best format:** Mass start distance events. The Tour de Ski 5th and consistent top-10 distance results confirm this.
- **Climbing ability:** Strong enough for Tour de Ski 5th (which includes the Alpe Cermis final climb at Val di Fiemme -- the same venue as this 50km).

## 50km/Long Distance Race History
Competes in 50km mass start events as listed in his FIS competition repertoire. Specific 50km race results not confirmed in search, but his entry in the discipline category on FIS confirms experience at the distance. -- [the-sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/beda-klee-cross-country-skiing-spf327995.html)

## Key Storylines

### Cologna's Successor
Beda Klee has emerged as Switzerland's leading distance skier following the retirement of Dario Cologna (4x Olympic champion). His 13th overall in the 2023-24 World Cup and multiple top-10 finishes mark him as Switzerland's benchmark in the 10/20km distances. The 50km represents an opportunity to follow in Cologna's footsteps at the longest distance.

### The Toggenburg Farmer
Klee's motto is "It's not much, but it's honest work!" reflecting a grounded approach. He trains with French coach Francois Faivre, emphasizing enjoyment of the sport as fundamental to success. His philosophy: "Go into the competition because you enjoy the sport and train regularly. The results will then automatically come to you." -- [Datasport](https://datasport.com/en/essentials/interview-with-beda-klee/)

### Injury Comeback
Klee was noted as injured as of March 2025, which may explain some inconsistency in the early 2025-26 season. His form appeared to improve through the season, peaking with the 10th at Goms in January 2026.
