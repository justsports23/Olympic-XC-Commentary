**Season summary:** A remarkable comeback season. Iversen was not initially selected for the World Cup squad and had made only 6 WC starts in the two prior seasons combined. He forced his way back through Norwegian Cup performances, then delivered 3 podiums and 5 top-5 finishes in 9 WC races. His 5th place in the Tour de Ski and 2nd in the Goms 20km Classic Mass Start demonstrated he was in peak form heading into the Olympics. His selection for the Olympic team was controversial but justified by results.

## Milano Cortina 2026 Olympic Results (prior to 50km)

| Date | Event | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 15 Feb 2026 | 4x7.5km Relay | **GOLD** | 1st leg (classic); coach praised his classic form: "Emil has been in great form all year and has put in some good performances in the classics" — [olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/johannes-hosflot-kl%C3%A6bo-wins-historic-ninth-olympic-gold-norway-cross-country-skiing-relay-milano-cortina-2026), [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-who-are-the-norwegians-the-french-will-face-in-the-relay-0214/) |

**Olympic context:** Iversen was selected for the relay (1st leg, classic technique) based on his classic-technique strength. Norway won by 22.2 seconds. His selection for the 50km reflects his proven ability in long-distance classic races and his 2021 World Championship gold in the 50km.

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** **Elite -- one of the best classic-technique distance skiers in the world.** Selected for the relay 1st leg (classic) at the Olympics. Won the 2021 WCH 50km in classic. 2nd in the 20km Classic Mass Start at Goms.
- **Freestyle strength:** Capable but not his primary asset. Classic is clearly his stronger technique.
- **Sprint ability:** Had sprint ability earlier in career (WCH Team Sprint gold) but has transitioned to focus on distance events.
- **Distance preference:** Long distance, particularly classic. His best results come in 20km+ classic races.
- **Best format:** Mass start classic distance. The 50km Classic Mass Start is arguably his ideal event.
- **Climbing ability:** Strong. Won the 50km at Oberstdorf which included the full Burgstall climb on every lap.

## 50km/Long Distance Race History
| Date | Event | Venue | Discipline | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Mar 2021 | WCH 50km MS Classic | Oberstdorf, GER | Classic | **GOLD** | 2:10:52.9; Beat Bolshunov by 0.7s and Krueger by 8.2s. Originally 2nd but upgraded after Klaebo DQ. Led the race from early stages. — [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2020-21/memorable-final-day-at-world-championships-oberstdorf-2021) |

**50km assessment:** Iversen is the **reigning 50km Classic World Champion** from Oberstdorf 2021 (albeit via Klaebo's disqualification). He was at the front of that race throughout, finishing just 0.7 seconds ahead of Bolshunov and 8.2 seconds ahead of Krueger. His current classic form -- 2nd in the Goms 20km Classic Mass Start, 3rd in Tour de Ski classic stages -- suggests he is capable of contending in this 50km. His experience and tactical acumen over 50km are assets.

## Key Storylines

### The Comeback King
Iversen's journey to these Olympics is one of the most compelling stories in cross-country skiing. After making only 6 World Cup starts in two seasons, the 34-year-old was initially **not selected for the Ruka World Cup opener** in November 2025. He responded by dominating the Norwegian Cup and declared, "Now they can't avoid me." He then delivered a World Cup podium in Trondheim -- his first in approximately five years -- and never looked back, eventually earning his Olympic selection. — [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-now-they-cant-avoid-me-not-selected-for-ruka-emil-iversen-responds-in-the-norwegian-cup-1128/), [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-wins-but-iversen-s-day-with-first-podium-in-five-years)

### Controversial Olympic Selection
Iversen's selection for the Olympic team was met with criticism from some quarters, given his limited World Cup appearances in prior seasons. However, his results in the 2025-26 season -- particularly 5th in the Tour de Ski and 2nd at Goms -- silenced most doubters. — [Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/emil-iversen-to-the-olympics-after-criticized-selection), [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/01/the-cost-of-being-the-best-norway-finally-locks-in-its-olympic-squad/)

### The 2021 50km Connection
Iversen won the 50km Classic World Championship at Oberstdorf in 2021 -- the same race where Klaebo was disqualified for contact with Bolshunov. That history adds a layer of narrative to this Olympic 50km: Iversen is the last man to win a major championship 50km classic that Klaebo did not win. — [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2020-21/memorable-final-day-at-world-championships-oberstdorf-2021)

### The Veteran's Last Dance
At 34 years old, this is almost certainly Iversen's final Olympic event. After years of struggle and a near-exit from top-level skiing, the 50km Classic represents both a redemption story and a potential career-defining moment. His selection for the classic relay leg (which Norway won) showed the coaching staff's confidence in his classic-technique mastery.

### Classic Specialist in the Right Race
The 50km Mass Start Classic format plays precisely to Iversen's greatest strengths. He is a proven classic-technique distance racer, a former 50km World Champion, and has shown form in classic-technique WC races all season (3rd in TdS Toblach 10km Classic, 2nd in Goms 20km Classic Mass Start). Of all four Norwegians, Iversen may have the strongest pure classic-technique pedigree for a 50km race.
