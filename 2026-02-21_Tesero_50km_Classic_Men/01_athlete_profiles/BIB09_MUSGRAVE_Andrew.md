## Personal Background

Andrew Musgrave is a five-time Olympian and Great Britain's greatest ever cross-country skier. Born in Poole, Dorset, his early years featured much travel due to his father Frank's job in the oil industry — the family lived in the Shetland Islands, followed by a spell in Alaska, before settling in Huntly, Aberdeenshire. He was introduced to cross-country skiing at around age 11 through the Huntly Nordic Ski Club — [olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/andrew-musgrave-norway-british-cross-country-skiing).

Recognizing the limited opportunities in the United Kingdom, Musgrave relocated to Trondheim, Norway, at age 16 — where he has lived and trained for over 23 years. He competes for Norwegian club Roea IL while maintaining his British racing affiliation — [olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/andrew-musgrave-norway-british-cross-country-skiing).

He is the younger brother of former cross-country skier Posy Musgrave, and has another older sister Heather and an older brother Ben — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Musgrave).

On his love of the 50km, Musgrave has said: *"Winning the 50K is every cross-country skier's dream"* — [Swix](https://swixsport.com/eu/article/ambassadors/andrew-musgrave). He has been a Swix athlete for years: *"Swix has been part of my journey, and I'm proud to be a Swix athlete"* — [Swix](https://swixsport.com/eu/article/ambassadors/andrew-musgrave).

- **Sprint ability:** Not competitive at sprint level.
- **Distance preference:** Marathon/ultra-distance specialist. His best results consistently come in the longest events (50km, skiathlon).
- **Best format:** 50km mass start and skiathlon — formats that reward endurance, tactical patience, and late-race strength.
- **Climbing ability:** Strong — marathon racing demands sustained climbing power.

## Key Storylines

### The Five-Time Olympian
At 35, Musgrave is competing at his fifth Olympic Winter Games — an extraordinary feat of longevity that places him in elite company among British winter sports athletes. He became only the fifth British athlete to reach five Winter Olympics — [olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/andrew-musgrave-norway-british-cross-country-skiing).

### The 50km Dream
The 50km has been Musgrave's white whale throughout his career. His agonizing 4th place at the 2017 Lahti World Championships — missing the podium by less than 2 seconds — remains one of the closest calls in British Nordic skiing history. At 6th in the 50km at the 2025 Worlds, he remains a genuine contender. *"Winning the 50K is every cross-country skier's dream,"* he has said — [Swix](https://swixsport.com/eu/article/ambassadors/andrew-musgrave).

### British at Heart, Norwegian by Training
Musgrave's story is unique in the cross-country world: a Scotsman who moved to Trondheim at 16 and has spent 23 years training alongside Norwegian stars while always competing under the British flag. He competes for Norwegian club Roea IL but wears British colors with immense pride — [olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/andrew-musgrave-norway-british-cross-country-skiing).

### A Hot Streak at the Olympics
Musgrave's 6th place in the 10km free at these Games — the best-ever British Olympic XC result — suggests he is in strong form at the Tesero venue. Combined with his 2024-25 form (2nd at Trondheim WC, Tour de Ski podium), he arrives as a legitimate dark horse for a top-10 or even podium finish — [Team GB](https://www.teamgb.com/article/andrew-musgrave-seals-gbs-best-ever-cross-country-result-at-an-olympic-games/6XXD6tk4CLSH1VfsAp1RwS).

### The Shirtless Running Story
In a widely reported anecdote, Musgrave's strong Olympic form followed a period of shirtless running during training — a story that captured media attention — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-andrew-musgraves-hot-streak-after-running-shirtless-0213/).
