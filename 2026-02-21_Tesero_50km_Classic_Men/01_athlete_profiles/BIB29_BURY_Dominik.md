- **Distance preference:** Distance-oriented, with best results in multi-stage events (Tour de Ski) and longer individual races.

## Key Storylines

### Polish Cross-Country Renaissance
Bury is at the center of a historic period for Polish cross-country skiing. The 2025-26 Tour de Ski saw 7 Polish athletes complete the full multi-stage event -- a first for the country that was previously limited to 1-2 finishers per year. Bury, as the team leader and most experienced racer, has helped build the depth of the Polish program. -- [Svexa](https://svexa.com/historic-success-for-the-polish-national-ski-team-at-tour-de-ski-2025-2026/)

### Three-Time Olympian and National Pioneer
At his third Olympics, Bury is Poland's most experienced male cross-country skier. He has been the standard-bearer for Polish XC skiing through three Olympic cycles (2018, 2022, 2026), representing the country at 5 World Championships.

### The Bury Brothers
Dominik and his brother Kamil Bury both compete as cross-country skiers for Poland, creating a family dynamic within the national team.

### Val di Fiemme Familiarity
Bury completed the Tour de Ski (which concludes at Val di Fiemme) with a 23rd overall finish in January 2026, giving him recent course knowledge. His Olympic skiathlon (33rd) was also raced on this course.

### Realistic 50km Target
Given his typical 30th-45th range in World Cup distance events and 23rd TdS overall, Bury's realistic target for the 50km would be a top-25 to top-30 finish. A sub-25th finish would be a strong result.
