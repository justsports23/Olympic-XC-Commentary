## Personal Background

Gabriel Cojocaru is one of Romania's emerging cross-country skiing talents. Born in 2003, he is among the younger athletes in the 50km field at just 22 years old. Romania has a long history of participation in cross-country skiing at the Olympic level, though the country has rarely challenged for top results. Cojocaru represents the next generation of Romanian skiers looking to raise the nation's profile in the sport.

Romania's cross-country skiing program draws athletes from the Carpathian Mountain regions, where the country's best training conditions can be found. The Romanian delegation at Milano Cortina 2026 includes 29 athletes across multiple winter sports, with cross-country skiing being one of the core disciplines. -- [Romania Insider](https://www.romania-insider.com/romania-team-winter-olympics-2026), [Romania Journal](https://www.romaniajournal.ro/sports/romanian-athletes-full-schedule-at-2026-winter-olympics-in-milan-cortina/)

Cojocaru's progression from Junior World Championships (53rd) to a World Cup best of 67th and a World Championship relay result of 18th shows a consistent upward trajectory for a skier still in his early twenties. His inclusion in the 50km mass start speaks to Romania's strategy of maximizing their athletes' Olympic experience.
