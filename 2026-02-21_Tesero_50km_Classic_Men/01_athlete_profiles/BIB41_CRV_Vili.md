## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Solid. Crv's sprint classic result (43rd at Olympics) and his regular classic event participation suggest competent classic technique. As a Slovenian trained at the famed Planica/Ratece center, he has strong technical foundations.
- **Freestyle strength:** Comparable to classic. Versatile across both techniques at World Cup level.
- **Sprint ability:** Moderate. Has competed in sprint events at World Championships and Olympics, typically qualifying but not advancing deep into heats.
- **Distance preference:** All-around, with slightly better results in shorter distances (10-15km) than ultra-distance events.
- **Best format:** Relay and team sprint (career-best 10th came in team sprint). Individual distance events typically yield 40th-60th range finishes.
- **Climbing ability:** [DATA NOT FOUND specifically, but consistent results on varied courses suggest adequate climbing capacity]

## 50km/Long Distance Race History
[DATA NOT FOUND] -- No confirmed 50km results found. This may be his first elite-level 50km race in classic technique.

## Key Storylines

### Slovenia's Distance Workhorse
Vili Crv is the backbone of Slovenian men's cross-country skiing, carrying the nation's flag at distance events across World Cups, World Championships, and now two Olympic Games. For a country with a strong ski jumping tradition but limited cross-country infrastructure, Crv's consistent presence at the highest level is a significant achievement. He was one of eight Slovenian skiers selected for the 2025 Trondheim World Championships, alongside Eva Urevc who leads the women's program. -- [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-skiing-slovenias-selection-for-the-world-cross-country-skiing-nordic-combined-and-ski-jumping-championships-in-trondheim-0219/)

### Planica Training Base
Training out of ND Ratece - Planica, one of Slovenia's most storied winter sports venues, Crv benefits from the Nordic infrastructure built around the famous Planica ski jumping hill. The Nordic center there provides year-round training facilities for Slovenia's small but committed cross-country program. -- [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=192828)

### Course Familiarity
Crv has raced extensively in the Val di Fiemme region, including at the Tour de Ski and in the Olympic skiathlon. His 42nd in the Val di Fiemme World Cup race gives him recent course knowledge, though translating that to a 50km effort in classic will be a new challenge.

### Birthday Boy
Crv turns 27 on February 19, just two days before the 50km race. He will enter the biggest race of his career fresh off his birthday celebrations.
