## Season Form (2025-26)

| Date | Event | Location | Discipline | Format | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|------------|--------|--------|-------|
| 2024-25 season | World Championships | Trondheim, NOR | 50km Freestyle | Mass Start | **13th** | Career-best WCH result in his signature event (2:04:07.0) -- [FIS Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=CC&raceid=46944) |
| 8 Feb 2026 | **Olympics** | Tesero, ITA | Skiathlon 20km | Mass Start | **35th** | Best-ever Olympic skiathlon result -- [Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/2026/02/08/irelands-thomas-maloney-westgard-enjoys-best-result-in-winter-olympics-skiathlon/) |
| 13 Feb 2026 | **Olympics** | Tesero, ITA | 10km Free | Interval | **54th** | "I didn't really have the last gear today" -- [The 42](https://www.the42.ie/thomas-maloney-westgard-cross-country-skiing-6956173-Feb2026/) |

**Season summary:** Maloney Westgaard's 13th at the 2025 World Championships 50km was a career-defining result that confirmed his status as one of the world's best marathon-distance skiers outside the traditional powerhouse nations. His Olympic skiathlon 35th was an improvement, but the 10km free was disappointing at 54th. Now enters the 50km classic mass start -- his signature event and the race he has been building toward all season. As he has said: *"The longer it is the better it goes."* -- [RTE Sport](https://www.rte.ie/sport/other-sport/2026/0129/1555819-thomas-maloney-westgaard-man-of-fire-and-ice/)

## Personal Background

Thomas Hjalmar Maloney Westgaard was born on the tiny island of Leka in Nord-Trondelag, Norway. His father is Norwegian and his mother is from Galway, Ireland -- making him a dual citizen of both countries. He grew up in Norway and was raised in the Norwegian skiing culture but chose to compete internationally for Ireland, giving the nation a rare presence in elite Nordic skiing. -- [RTE Sport](https://www.rte.ie/sport/other-sport/2026/0129/1555819-thomas-maloney-westgaard-man-of-fire-and-ice/)

Described as a "man of fire and ice," Maloney Westgaard lives for the slog of distance racing. He joined Team Aker Daehlie, a Norwegian-based professional training group, which has been instrumental in his development. *"It has really benefited me. I have a good training group that I'm with,"* he has said about the setup. -- [RTE Sport](https://www.rte.ie/sport/other-sport/2026/0129/1555819-thomas-maloney-westgaard-man-of-fire-and-ice/)

On representing Ireland: *"I love the sport and yeah, representing Ireland, the Olympics, it has always been the biggest dream since I've been a child. I felt like I've been improving every year since I started professionally."* -- [RTE Sport](https://www.rte.ie/sport/other-sport/2026/0129/1555819-thomas-maloney-westgaard-man-of-fire-and-ice/)

His mother's family has strong connections to Dunmore, County Galway. -- [Tuam Herald](https://www.tuamherald.ie/2026/02/04/ireland-skier-from-norway-with-strong-dunmore-links/)

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Strong. His 13th at the WCH 50km freestyle suggests elite endurance, and while that was in free technique, his Norwegian upbringing ensures solid classic foundations. However, the 50km at these Olympics is in classic technique rather than his preferred freestyle.
- **Freestyle strength:** Very strong. His best distance results (WCH 13th in 50km free, Beijing 14th in 15km classic) show he is versatile but may lean freestyle.
- **Sprint ability:** Limited. Not a sprint specialist -- his strength is in grinding distance events.
- **Distance preference:** Ultra-distance / marathon. *"The longer it is the better it goes."* The 50km is his signature event. -- [RTE Sport](https://www.rte.ie/sport/other-sport/2026/0129/1555819-thomas-maloney-westgaard-man-of-fire-and-ice/)
- **Best format:** Mass start distance events (50km, skiathlon). The mass start format suits his steady, grinding racing style.
- **Climbing ability:** [DATA NOT FOUND]

## Key Storylines

### Ireland's Lone Wolf on the Longest Day
Maloney Westgaard is the sole Irish cross-country skier at these Games and has carried the flag for his nation at the opening ceremony. In the 50km, he competes not just against the world's best but against the isolation of representing a non-traditional skiing nation with no teammates to share the workload. His Norwegian training base and Team Aker Daehlie affiliation give him the preparation of a Scandinavian athlete, wrapped in an Irish tricolor. -- [RTE](https://www.rte.ie/sport/olympics/2026/0203/1556567-maloney-westgaard-and-zurbay-to-carry-irish-flag/)

### The 50km Specialist
This is the race Maloney Westgaard has been building toward. His WCH 13th in the 50km at Trondheim proved he belongs among the world's top 15 ultra-distance skiers. His Olympic 35th in the skiathlon and 54th in the 10km show the pattern clearly: the longer the race, the better he performs. The 50km mass start classic is his chance to deliver Ireland's best-ever Winter Olympic cross-country result.

### Classic vs. Freestyle Challenge
A key variable: Maloney Westgaard's best 50km results have come in freestyle. This Olympic 50km is in classic technique. His Beijing 14th in 15km classic demonstrates he is competent in the technique, but the switch from free to classic over 50km adds uncertainty. Norwegian-raised skiers typically have excellent classic foundations, which should help.

### Three Games, Three Chances
At 30, this could be Maloney Westgaard's final Olympics. PyeongChang (2018), Beijing (2022), and now Milano Cortina (2026) -- each Games has seen incremental improvement. The 50km is his last event and his best chance to cap the trilogy with a career-defining performance.

### Man of Fire and Ice
RTE's profile dubbed him a "man of fire and ice" -- fire for his competitive drive and Irish passion, ice for his Norwegian upbringing and the frozen landscapes he trains in. It is a fitting description for a dual-identity athlete who bridges two sporting cultures. -- [RTE Sport](https://www.rte.ie/sport/other-sport/2026/0129/1555819-thomas-maloney-westgaard-man-of-fire-and-ice/)
