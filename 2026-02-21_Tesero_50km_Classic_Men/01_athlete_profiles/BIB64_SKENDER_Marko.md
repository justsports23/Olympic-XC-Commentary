## Personal Background

Marko Skender is Croatia's leading male cross-country skier, born on July 9, 2001, in Rijeka -- Croatia's third-largest city and its main port on the Adriatic coast. Rijeka is not typically associated with winter sports; it is a Mediterranean city known for its seafront, its carnival, and its maritime heritage. That a cross-country skier emerged from this coastal city makes Skender's story all the more remarkable.

Croatia has a small but dedicated winter sports community, centered primarily in the mountainous interior regions of Gorski Kotar and the Lika plateau, where snow conditions allow for winter sports training. The country is better known internationally for Alpine skiing (the legendary Janica and Ivica Kostelic) than for cross-country, making Skender something of a pioneer in raising the profile of Nordic skiing in Croatia.

At the Beijing 2022 Olympics, the 20-year-old Skender carried the Croatian flag at the Opening Ceremony -- an enormous honor for a young athlete at his first Games. He then went on to compete in three events, with his best result being a 57th in the 50km mass start freestyle. That result remains his most notable career achievement and demonstrates his suitability for marathon-distance racing. -- [Total Croatia News](https://total-croatia-news.com/news/sport/2022-croatia-winter-olympic-team/), [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/marko-skender)

For the 2026 Games, Croatia is represented by 14 athletes across four sports, with Skender joined in the cross-country skiing contingent by women's skiers Tena Hadzic and Ema Sobol. Skender is the sole Croatian male cross-country skier. -- [Croatia Week](https://www.croatiaweek.com/croatia-14-athletes-milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics/), [HINA](https://www.hina.hr/news/12185309)

With five World Championship appearances by the age of 24, Skender has accumulated substantial international experience. His European Cup and FIS-level racing has kept him competitive, and he enters the 50km with the specific advantage of having raced at Lago di Tesero during national championships in 2025, giving him course knowledge that many of his competitors will lack.

## Key Storylines

### From the Adriatic Coast to the Snow Marathon
Skender's journey from the Mediterranean port city of Rijeka to the Olympic cross-country skiing course is a story of defying geographic expectations. Rijeka is a city of seaside promenades and maritime tradition, not snow-covered trails. Yet from this unlikely starting point, Skender has built a career that includes two Olympics and five World Championships. -- [Total Croatia News](https://total-croatia-news.com/news/sport/2022-croatia-winter-olympic-team/)

### Beijing Flag Bearer Returns
Four years after carrying the Croatian flag at the Beijing Opening Ceremony, Skender returns to the Olympic 50km as a more experienced and mature athlete. His 57th in the Beijing 50km gives him a benchmark to chase, and the switch from freestyle to classic technique will be an interesting variable.

### Five World Championships by 24
Five World Championship appearances at just 24 years old represents exceptional international experience. Skender has been competing at the highest level since his late teens and brings a level of big-race maturity that belies his relatively young age.

### Course Familiarity
Having raced at Lago di Tesero during 2025 national championships, Skender has course knowledge that is invaluable in a 50km race. Knowing where the climbs hit, where the descents allow recovery, and how the stadium finish plays out can save valuable seconds and help with pacing strategy.

### Croatian Nordic Pioneer
While Croatia is famous for Janica Kostelic's Alpine skiing dominance, cross-country skiing remains a niche discipline. Skender is helping to build the profile of Nordic skiing in Croatia and may inspire future generations of Croatian cross-country skiers.
