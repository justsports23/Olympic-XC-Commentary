**Season summary:** Two World Cup victories, both in classic technique (10km Classic in Ruka and 10km Classic in Oberhof). This is significant -- Nyenget is demonstrably the strongest classic-technique distance skier in the field this season besides Klaebo. After "weeks of training like crazy," he demolished the field in Oberhof by 13.8 seconds.

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** **Elite -- arguably the best pure classic distance skier on this start list.** Both 2025-26 WC victories came in classic technique. Won his first-ever WC race in the 50km Classic at Oslo. The Oberhof 10km Classic win by 13.8 seconds demonstrates exceptional classic-technique superiority.
- **Freestyle strength:** Strong. Skiathlon bronze at Olympics shows he can compete in both techniques, though classic is his clear preference.
- **Sprint ability:** Limited. Not a natural sprinter; relies on sustained power over distance.
- **Distance preference:** Long distance specialist. His breakthrough came in the 50km. At his best in races 10km+.
- **Best format:** Interval start classic and mass start long distance classic.
- **Climbing ability:** Strong. Has the endurance profile for sustained climbing efforts. Described as "one of the few skiers capable of attacking early and sustaining a solo effort." — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-50km-mass-start/)

## 50km/Long Distance Race History
| Date | Event | Venue | Discipline | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Mar 2022 | WC 50km MS Classic | Oslo (Holmenkollen), NOR | Classic | **1st** | 2:03:27.3; First WC win; emotional victory dedicated to late father — [InsideTheGames](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1120173/nyenget-first-cross-country-world-cup), [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2021-22/maiden-world-cup-victory-at-holmenkollen-50km) |
| Mar 2025 | WC 50km MS Classic | Lahti, FIN | Classic | 2nd | +0.5s behind Klaebo — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/klaebo-wins-50km-mass-start-classic-at-the-lahti-world-cup/) |

**50km assessment:** Nyenget is a proven 50km classic specialist. His first-ever World Cup victory was the 50km Classic at Holmenkollen, and he pushed Klaebo to within 0.5 seconds in the Lahti 50km Classic. The classic technique and long-distance format of this Olympic 50km plays directly to his greatest strengths. He is considered the most likely Norwegian to join Klaebo on the podium. — [NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/50km-race-johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-could-sweep-mens-cross-country-skiing-olympic-gold)

## Key Storylines

### The Emotional First Win
Nyenget's first World Cup victory -- the 50km Classic at Oslo in March 2022 -- came just two weeks after his father's death. He attended his father's funeral just two days before the race, then won in 2:03:27.3, leading a Norwegian 1-2-3 (Rothe 2nd, Tonseth 3rd). He dedicated the victory to his late father. — [InsideTheGames](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1120173/nyenget-first-cross-country-world-cup), [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2021-22/maiden-world-cup-victory-at-holmenkollen-50km)

### Late Bloomer, Perfect Timing
At 33 years old, Nyenget is competing in his first Olympics -- remarkably late for an elite cross-country skier. He became a consistent top performer only in the last 3-4 seasons, with his career peaking at exactly the right time for the Milano Cortina Games. His two Olympic medals (relay gold, skiathlon bronze) already represent a dream debut.

### "Training Like Crazy"
After his Oberhof 10km Classic victory in January 2026, Nyenget described weeks of intense training that paid off. This suggests he arrived at the Olympics in peak physical condition, having deliberately built toward this moment. — [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/Weeks-of-training-like-crazy-pay-off-as-Nyenget-wins-in-Oberhof)

### The Solo Attack Threat
Nyenget is described as "one of the few skiers capable of attacking early and sustaining a solo effort" in 50km races. His strength is sustained power over long distances rather than a finishing sprint. In a mass start 50km, this makes him tactically dangerous -- he may try to break away on the climbs rather than risk a sprint finish against Klaebo.

### Classic Technique Master
Both of Nyenget's 2025-26 WC victories came in classic technique distance races. The 50km Classic format is his ideal event. His 13.8-second margin of victory at Oberhof in classic technique demonstrates a level of dominance rarely seen.
