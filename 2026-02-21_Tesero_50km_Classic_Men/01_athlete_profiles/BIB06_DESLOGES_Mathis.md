## Personal Background

Mathis Desloges is a 23-year-old French cross-country skier from the Vercors massif who has emerged as the breakout star of the 2026 Olympic Winter Games. Born in Saint-Martin-d'Heres and raised in Villard-de-Lans, he is a passionate lover of nature who regularly expresses concern about climate change threatening the sustainability of his sport and the survival of mid-mountain ski resorts. When asked what he prefers about his discipline, he answers without hesitation: *"Training in nature"* — [olympics.com (FR)](https://www.olympics.com/fr/milano-cortina-2026/actualite/jo-hiver-milano-cortina-2026-ski-de-fond-cinq-choses-savoir-mathis-desloges).

His father Vincent Desloges has been a central figure in his development. After Mathis won his first Olympic silver, Vincent told Nordic Magazine: *"It was unimaginable"* — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-it-was-unimaginable-vincent-desloges-mathis-father-tells-nordic-magazine-how-he-experienced-his-sons-individual-silver-medal-0214/).

After his historic skiathlon silver, Desloges said: *"I'm the one wearing the medal, but we're all entitled to it"* — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-mathis-desloges-talks-to-nordic-magazine-after-his-historic-silver-medal-in-the-skiathlon-im-the-one-wearing-the-medal-but-were-all-entitled-to-it-0209/). He also noted: *"It's incredible, I still can't believe it. I still haven't landed, that's for sure."*

When his medal accidentally broke during celebrations, he quipped: *"Too many emotions. We moved and jumped a lot, and in the end the medal jumped too"* — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/olympic-games-2026-cross-country-skiing-completely-shattered-mathis-desloges-silver-medal-was-too-emotional-to-resist-0208/).

Desloges is also known for unconventional preparation methods, including extensive treadmill skiing: *"I ate hours of carpet"* — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-i-ate-hours-of-carpet-olympic-skiathlon-medallist-mathis-desloges-tells-nordic-magazine-the-secrets-of-his-preparation-0210/).

## Key Storylines

### The Revelation of the Games
International media dubbed Desloges *"the revelation of these Olympic Games 2026"* after his stunning silver medal double — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/olympic-games-2026-cross-country-skiing-the-revelation-of-these-olympic-games-2026-mathis-desloges-silver-medal-in-the-individual-skate-event-as-seen-from-abroad-0213/). He was congratulated by French President Emmanuel Macron — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-emmanuel-macron-congratulates-mathis-desloges-0208/) — and even by Grenoble Foot 38, his local football club — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/olympic-games-2026-cross-country-skiing-mathis-desloges-congratulated-by-grenoble-foot-38-after-winning-silver-in-the-olympic-skiathlon-0209/).

### From U23 Champion to Triple Olympic Medalist in One Year
Just 18 months before Milan-Cortina, Desloges was winning at the U23 level in Planica. His rapid ascent from U23 champion to triple Olympic silver medalist is one of the most remarkable development stories in recent cross-country skiing history.

### The Course-Cutting Scare
During the skiathlon, Desloges received a warning after cutting straight across a course marker near the 13km mark. The jury deliberated at length before allowing his result to stand — a moment that could have cost him his historic medal — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-15-minutes-before-his-silver-medal-the-moment-when-mathis-desloges-could-have-lost-everything-in-the-skiathlon-0208/).

### Can He Go 4 for 4?
With three silver medals already in his pocket, Desloges could become the most decorated French cross-country skier in a single Games. The 50km classic is uncharted territory for the 23-year-old, but his coach Thibaut Chene has noted: *"He was perhaps the one who arrived on this circuit with the least certainty, and he really responded"* — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-mathis-desloges-2024-2025-season-as-seen-by-thibaut-chene-he-was-perhaps-the-one-who-arrived-on-this-circuit-with-the-least-certainty-and-he-really-responded-0414/).

### Environmental Advocate
Desloges has been vocal about climate change threatening winter sports, adding a layer of meaning to his performances on what may become an increasingly rare Olympic stage for snow sports.
