## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Strong but not his primary technique. Most major wins have come in freestyle/skate. Classic is considered his secondary technique.
- **Freestyle strength:** Elite. Won multiple 20km Mass Start Free races. His preferred technique.
- **Sprint ability:** Moderate. Not a natural sprinter; 14th in Olympic sprint.
- **Distance preference:** Long distance specialist. At his best in 20km+ races.
- **Best format:** Mass start free. Won back-to-back 20km Mass Start Free titles in Ruka.
- **Climbing ability:** Strong. Won Tour de Ski 2023-24 which concludes with the Alpe Cermis final climb.

## 50km/Long Distance Race History
| Date | Event | Venue | Discipline | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Mar 2025 | WCH 50km MS Free | Trondheim, NOR | Free | 5th | Led the pack late but faded in final 6km — [olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-sixth-gold-2025-worlds--mens-50km-mass-start) |
| Mar 2024 | WC 50km MS Classic | Oslo (Holmenkollen), NOR | Classic | 4th | — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/klaebo-wins-holmenkollen-50km/) |

**50km assessment:** Amundsen has shown he can compete in 50km races but has not yet achieved a podium finish in one. His tendency to fade in the final kilometers of ultra-long races (as seen at Trondheim WCH) is a concern. The classic technique requirement in this Olympic 50km is also less favorable for him than freestyle would be.

## Key Storylines

### The Medal-less Favorite
Amundsen arrived at these Olympics as the 2024 Overall World Cup champion and one of the strongest distance skiers in the world. Yet through five events, he has **zero medals** at his first Olympic Games. The 50km is his last shot. — [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-with-johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-and-harald-oestberg-amundsen-norways-selection-for-the-50-km-classic-0219/)

### Respiratory Issues
Amundsen has dealt with breathing difficulties since the Davos World Cup in December 2025. He described the feeling as being "suffocated" during the Tour de Ski, where he finished a disappointing 9th. The question is whether he has fully recovered for this final Olympic event. — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/feels-like-im-being-suffocated/)

### The Korostelev Incident
In the Olympic skiathlon, Amundsen was involved in a collision with Russian skier Saveliy Korostelev during the ski change zone, which disrupted his race and contributed to his 6th-place finish. — [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-what-happened-between-norways-harald-oestberg-amundsen-and-russias-saveliy-korostelev-0208/)

### Classic Technique Question
While Amundsen is an elite distance skier, his greatest wins have come in freestyle technique. The 50km in classic technique is less favorable for him than a freestyle race would be. His 4th at the Oslo 50km Classic and 5th at the Trondheim WCH 50km (which was freestyle) suggest he can contend but may lack the finishing edge of a pure classic specialist.
