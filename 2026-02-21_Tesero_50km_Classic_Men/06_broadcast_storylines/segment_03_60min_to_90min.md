# SEGMENT OVERVIEW

The decisive phase. Between 25 and 37 kilometres, the race transforms from a war of attrition into a war of aggression. This is where surges are launched, breakaways are attempted, and the field shatters into medal contenders and everyone else. The storylines shift from patience to action: nutrition, legendary champions, altitude effects, and the tactical chess match that will determine who stands on the podium.

# STORYLINE 1: THE DECISIVE PHASE — WHERE RACES ARE WON AND LOST

## The Third Quarter

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "We are now in the third quarter of this race. From 25 to 37 kilometres — this is the crucible. Every great 50km champion will tell you the same thing: the first half is about survival; the second half is about courage. And this is where the courageous make their move."

## Why This Phase Is Critical

The period between 25-37km of a 50km race is critical for several overlapping reasons:

1. **Glycogen reserves are depleted enough that differences in fuelling strategy become apparent** — athletes who have eaten and drunk effectively are stronger than those who have not
2. **Fatigue-resistant technique separates itself** — the gap between perfect form and deteriorating form widens with every kilometre
3. **Wax performance is fully revealed** — any advantage or disadvantage has now been compounding for over an hour
4. **Psychological barriers emerge** — the athletes know there is still 15-25km to go, and the mental weight of that distance begins to press
5. **The pack is small enough for individual tactics** — with perhaps 10-15 athletes remaining, individual moves become viable

## The Attack Patterns

In a mass-start 50km, attacks typically take one of these forms:

### The Climb Surge
The most common attack is a sharp acceleration on an uphill section. On a climb, drafting is less effective (lower speeds mean less aerodynamic benefit), so the cost of being at the front is lower. A strong climber can open a gap on a climb that the flatter-terrain specialists cannot close.

### The Tempo Grind
Rather than a single explosive surge, a team or individual gradually increases the pace over several kilometres, imperceptibly raising the effort level until weaker athletes simply cannot hold on.

### The Transition Attack
The most tactical move: accelerating at the transition from a descent into a flat or from a flat into a climb, where the change in terrain forces all athletes to adjust their technique simultaneously. The attacker, having planned the move, is ready for the transition; the defenders are caught reacting.

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Watch for the first serious attack. It usually comes on a climb — the leaders will suddenly accelerate, the tempo jumps, and three or four athletes will be dropped in a matter of seconds. That is the signal that the race for gold has begun."

> **KEY STAT BOX:**
> | Typical Attack Patterns in 50km | Description |
> |-------------------------------|-------------|
> | Climb Surge | Sharp acceleration uphill; reduced drafting benefit |
> | Tempo Grind | Gradual, sustained pace increase over 3-5 km |
> | Transition Attack | Accelerate at terrain change (descent-to-flat, flat-to-climb) |
> | Pre-feed Zone Push | Surge just before a feed zone to force others to skip nutrition |
> | Final Lap Breakaway | With 5-10km remaining, all-out effort to go solo |

# STORYLINE 2: NUTRITION IN THE RACE — FUELLING THE MACHINE

## The Feed Zones

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "You will see the athletes approaching feed zones roughly every 10 kilometres around the course. These are the pit stops of cross-country skiing. Coaches line the side of the track holding bottles, gels, and sometimes even fresh skis. The athletes slow slightly — though not much — grab what they need, and keep going. Missing a feed can be catastrophic. Taking too long at a feed can cost precious seconds."

## The Caloric Demands

Cross-country skiing is among the most energy-demanding sports in the world. Elite cross-country skiers burn approximately **30 calories per minute** during intense racing — a rate that translates to approximately **1,500-1,800 calories per hour** at race intensity. [Source: Ski Classics](https://skiclassics.com/long-distance-skiers-consume-an-astonishing-amount-of-calories/)

Over a 50km race lasting approximately 2:00-2:15:

> **KEY STAT BOX:**
> | Energy Demands of the Olympic 50km | Estimate |
> |-----------------------------------|----------|
> | Duration | ~2:00-2:15 |
> | Calorie Burn Per Hour | ~1,500-1,800 kcal |
> | Total Race Energy Expenditure | ~3,000-4,000 kcal |
> | Equivalent In Food | ~12-16 energy gels, or 6-8 large bananas, or 4-5 Big Macs |
> | Body Weight of Carbs Burned | ~500-700 g of glycogen |
> | Fluid Loss | ~1-2 litres per hour |

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Think about this: in the next two hours, these athletes will burn the caloric equivalent of what most people eat in an entire day. Three to four thousand calories. And they must replace as much of that as possible DURING the race, while skiing at 85 to 95 percent of their maximum capacity. The body simply cannot absorb calories fast enough to match what it is burning."

## What They Eat and Drink

Athletes consume a combination of:
- **Sports drinks** — carbohydrate-electrolyte solutions, served warm in cold conditions to prevent stomach shock
- **Energy gels** — concentrated carbohydrate packets, consumed quickly
- **Liquid food** — some teams prepare custom high-calorie liquid feeds

In long-distance racing, athletes aim to consume approximately **100 grams of carbohydrates every 15 to 20 minutes** — a challenging intake rate even while standing still, let alone while skiing at Olympic pace. [Source: Ski Classics](https://skiclassics.com/long-distance-skiers-consume-an-astonishing-amount-of-calories/)

## The Bonk

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "The worst thing that can happen to a distance skier — aside from a broken pole — is the bonk. In cycling, they call it 'hitting the wall.' In marathon running, it happens at 30 kilometres. In a 50km ski race, it can happen anywhere from 35 kilometres onward. The bonk is glycogen depletion — the body has run out of its primary fuel source. When it happens, the athlete slows dramatically, almost involuntarily. The legs turn to stone. The mind fogs. There is no recovering from a full bonk in a race."

## Dehydration Risk

Even in cold temperatures, dehydration is a significant concern. Athletes lose substantial fluid through respiration (breathing cold, dry air) and sweat. The dry mountain air at Tesero's 830m altitude further accelerates fluid loss through respiration.

# STORYLINE 3: GREAT 50KM CHAMPIONS IN HISTORY — THE LEGENDS

## The Pantheon

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "The Olympic 50km has produced a pantheon of legends — men who combined superhuman endurance, tactical brilliance, and an almost masochistic tolerance for pain. Let me tell you about the greatest of them."

## Bjorn Daehlie (NOR) — "The King"

**Bjorn Daehlie** is the most decorated male cross-country skier in Olympic history, with **8 gold medals and 4 silver medals** — 12 total across three Olympic Games (1992, 1994, 1998). [Source: Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bjorn-Daehlie)

His 50km Olympic record:
- **1992 Albertville**: Gold (50km) — his first Olympic 50km crown
- **1994 Lillehammer**: 4th place (50km) — the one that got away, in front of a home crowd
- **1998 Nagano**: Gold (50km) — his farewell race, won by 8 seconds over Sweden's Niklas Jonsson

[Source: Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/bjorn-daehlie-ends-his-olympic-career-in-style-in-nagano-in-1998)

Daehlie also won 9 World Championship gold medals, for a combined total of 29 Olympic and World Championship medals — the most in the history of men's cross-country skiing. [Source: Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/bjorn-daehlie)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Bjorn Daehlie is to cross-country skiing what Michael Jordan is to basketball. Eight Olympic golds. Twelve Olympic medals in total. Two 50km Olympic titles. He retired after Nagano in 1998 as the most successful Winter Olympian in history — a record that stood for more than two decades. His secret? A VO2max reported at over 90 ml/kg/min, among the highest ever recorded in any athlete. The man was a machine. An elegant, ruthless, smiling machine."

> **KEY STAT BOX:**
> | Bjorn Daehlie | Career Summary |
> |--------------|----------------|
> | Olympic Medals | 12 (8 Gold, 4 Silver) |
> | Olympic 50km Golds | 2 (1992, 1998) |
> | World Championship Medals | 17 (9 Gold) |
> | Combined Major Medals | 29 |
> | Active Olympic Years | 1992, 1994, 1998 |
> | Signature Strength | Incredible aerobic capacity + tactical patience |

## Thomas Wassberg (SWE) — The Razor's Edge

**Thomas Wassberg** won 4 Olympic gold medals: the 15km in 1980, the 50km and 4x10km relay in 1984, and the relay again in 1988. His 1984 50km victory in Sarajevo came by just **4.9 seconds** over his Swedish teammate Gunde Svan — at the time, the closest 50km finish in Olympic history. [Source: Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/98835)

## Gunde Svan (SWE) — The Swedish Icon

**Gunde Svan** won 4 Olympic medals at the 1984 Sarajevo Games: gold in the 15km and 4x10km relay, silver in the 50km, and bronze in the 30km. He then won the 50km gold at the **1988 Calgary Olympics**. [Source: Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/gunde-anders-svan)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Wassberg and Svan. Two Swedes, separated by 4.9 seconds in Sarajevo. That was the rivalry that defined the 1980s in Nordic skiing. Wassberg was the veteran, Svan the young gun. Their duel in the 1984 50km remains one of the great distance races in Olympic history."

## Vladimir Smirnov (KAZ) — The Lone Wolf

**Vladimir Smirnov** won the 50km gold at the **1994 Lillehammer Olympics** — the first Olympic gold medal in the history of independent Kazakhstan. He raced for the Soviet Union from 1982 to 1991, then for Kazakhstan. His career spanned the dissolution of the USSR itself. [Source: Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/vladimir-smirnov)

Smirnov also won the World Cup overall title in 1990-91 and 1993-94, and at the 1995 World Championships, he won three individual golds (10km, 30km, pursuit). [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Smirnov_(skier))

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Smirnov's story is one of the most remarkable in Olympic history. Born in Soviet Russia, he became the pride of a new nation. When he crossed the line first in Lillehammer, an entire country — Kazakhstan — celebrated its very first Olympic champion. In a sport dominated by Norwegians and Swedes, a man from the Central Asian steppes won the crown jewel."

## Mika Myllyla (FIN) — Brilliance and Tragedy

**Mika Myllyla** won the 50km at two consecutive World Championships — 1997 and 1999 — and took the 50km silver at the **1994 Lillehammer Olympics** (behind Smirnov). He also won Olympic gold in the 30km at the 1998 Nagano Games. His World Championship medal haul included 9 total medals (4 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze). [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_Myllyl%C3%A4)

His career was later engulfed by the 2001 Lahti doping scandal, and he tragically passed away in 2011 at the age of 41. [Source: FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2011/07/world-champion-olympic-hero-nice-guy-and-doper-mika-myllyla-is-dead-at-41/)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Myllyla was perhaps the most naturally gifted 50km racer of his generation. His double World Championship 50km victories in 1997 and 1999 were performances of breathtaking power. His story is also a cautionary tale about the pressures of elite sport and the dark shadow of doping that hung over cross-country skiing in the late 1990s and early 2000s."

## Sixten Jernberg (SWE) — The Pioneer

**Sixten Jernberg** won the Olympic 50km gold in **1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo** and defended his title at the **1964 Innsbruck Olympics**. He led the entire 1956 race and won by over a minute. Over his career (1956-1964), Jernberg won 9 Olympic medals (4 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze). [Source: Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/jernberg-wins-intense-50km-battle)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Here is a beautiful historical thread for today's race: the last time the Olympic 50km was held in this region of Italy was 1956, in Cortina d'Ampezzo — just 90 kilometres from here. And the winner was Sixten Jernberg of Sweden. Seventy years later, we return to the Italian Dolomites."

# STORYLINE 4: THE ROLE OF ALTITUDE

## Racing at 830 Metres

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "We are racing today at approximately 830 metres above sea level here in Tesero. That is not extreme altitude by any means — it is not like racing at 1,800 metres in Davos or at the high plateaus of Sjusjoen in Norway. But it is enough to affect performance, especially in an event as long and demanding as the 50km."

## The Science of Altitude and Performance

At 830 metres, barometric pressure is approximately 8-10% lower than at sea level, which means the partial pressure of oxygen is also reduced. For elite athletes operating at 85-95% of their VO2max for over two hours, even a modest reduction in available oxygen can affect performance.

Cross-country skiing places extreme demands on the cardiovascular system. The average workload during elite distance races is between **90-95% of VO2max**, with work rates spiking to approximately **120-160% of VO2peak** during uphill sections. [Source: PMC/NCBI](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6647095/)

> **KEY STAT BOX:**
> | Altitude Factor | Detail |
> |----------------|--------|
> | Tesero Altitude | ~830 m above sea level |
> | O2 Reduction vs. Sea Level | ~8-10% lower barometric pressure |
> | Race Intensity | 90-95% VO2max sustained |
> | Uphill Intensity Spikes | 120-160% VO2peak |
> | Most Affected Athletes | Those who train exclusively at low altitude |
> | Least Affected Athletes | Those with high-altitude training background |

## Altitude Training Backgrounds

The Norwegian cross-country ski team regularly incorporates altitude training camps into their preparation, typically spending 5-7 weeks per year at altitude locations. These camps are a standard component of the Norwegian training model. [Source: Norwegian SciTech News](https://norwegianscitechnews.com/2018/02/train-like-worlds-successful-female-cross-country-skier/)

- **Seiser Alm / Alpe di Siusi, Italy** (~1,850m) — traditional Scandinavian altitude camp location [Source: SkiTrax](https://skitrax.com/norwegian-cross-country-team-training-update/)
- **Park City, Utah, USA** (~2,100m) — Johannes Klaebo has used Utah as a training base for multiple autumns [Source: NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/02/nx-s1-5565238/meet-the-norwegian-olympic-superstar-who-trains-in-the-quiet-anonymity-of-utah)
- **Ramsau, Austria** (~1,100m) — used by Norwegian sprint team [Source: SkiTrax](https://skitrax.com/norwegian-cross-country-team-training-update/)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "The Norwegians have been training at altitude in Livigno — which is just a few hours north of here in the Italian Alps, at 1,800 metres — for years. They come to the Val di Fiemme already acclimatised. Nations that do not have the same altitude training infrastructure may feel the effects of even this modest elevation more acutely. Over 50 kilometres, those small physiological differences add up."

## Altitude and the Longer Race

The altitude effect is more pronounced in longer races for a simple reason: the longer the race, the more total oxygen is consumed, and the more a deficit in oxygen availability compounds. A 1-2% performance decrement that is invisible in a sprint becomes a 1-2 minute disadvantage over 50km.

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "If you see an athlete who has been strong all week suddenly fade in the second half of this 50km, altitude could be a contributing factor. Their body has been running at a slight oxygen deficit for over an hour, and the cumulative effect is now showing."

# STORYLINE 5: THE DECISIVE PHASE — BREAKAWAY, TACTICS, AND MEDAL CONTENTION

### The Breakaway Situation

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "This is the moment we have been waiting for. The decisive phase of the Olympic 50km. The classic specialists have been waiting for this — Nyenget, Niskanen, Iversen — they know the climbs are where this race is won. Watch for an attack on the forest climbs, where drafting is less effective and pure classic power separates the contenders from the pretenders."

#### Expected Race Dynamics (~30-35km)
| Group | Expected Athletes | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Breakaway Candidates | Nyenget (BIB 3), Niskanen (BIB 7), Iversen (BIB 4) | The classic specialists. If any of them attacks on a climb, Klaebo faces a choice: match or let go. |
| Lead Group | Klaebo (BIB 1), Amundsen (BIB 2), Desloges (BIB 6), Schumacher (BIB 5) | Sprinters and all-rounders — they need the group together for a sprint finish |
| Dangerous Passengers | Korostelev (BIB 12), Halfvarsson (BIB 20), Musgrave (BIB 9) | Sitting in, saving energy, waiting for the right moment |
| Third Group | Lapalus (BIB 8), Schely (BIB 23), Baba (BIB 28) | Racing for top 10-15. France may sacrifice Lapalus/Schely to set tempo for Desloges. |

### Who Is Working Together?

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Watch the team dynamics. Norway has the depth to control this race — Iversen and Nyenget can push the classic pace on the climbs while Klaebo sits behind, conserving his sprint. But here is the twist: Nyenget and Iversen both want to win. At some point, Norwegian team tactics become Norwegian individual ambition. That is when the race breaks open."

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Niskanen from Finland is alone in the group — he must be strategic about when to contribute and when to sit in. In PyeongChang 2018, he rode the pack for 40 kilometres, barely contributing to the pace. Then he changed skis and rode away from everyone. Watch for the same patient strategy today."

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Korostelev, the neutral athlete in BIB 12, is the ultimate lone wolf. No teammates. No flag to rally behind. No coaches in the feed zone except those assigned by the IOC. Everything he does, he does alone. But his 4th in the skiathlon proved he can compete with the very best — and he enters this race with unfinished business."

### Team Tactics in Action

- **Norway (BIBs 1, 2, 3, 4)**: 4 in lead group — Klaebo, Amundsen, Nyenget, Iversen. Nyenget and Iversen are the classic engines; Klaebo is being protected for the sprint. But if Nyenget attacks, does Klaebo follow or trust his teammates?
- **France (BIBs 6, 8, 17, 23)**: Desloges is the star — 3 silvers already. Lapalus and Schely are proven classic distance racers who can set tempo. A French-led tempo push on the climbs could disrupt Norwegian control.
- **Finland (BIBs 7, 14, 21, 37)**: Niskanen is the sole medal contender. His teammates may be out of the lead group by now, meaning Niskanen races alone — his preferred mode.
- **AIN (BIB 12)**: Korostelev — true lone wolf. No team tactics possible.
- **Germany (BIBs 15, 16, 38)**: Friedrich Moch (BIB 16) may still be in contact. His younger brother Jakob (BIB 38) — the birthday boy — is fighting just to survive.

### Critical Feed Zone

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "We are approaching the next feed zone. Watch carefully — will anyone change skis? In PyeongChang 2018, Niskanen changed skis at the 40km mark and won the gold. A ski change at this stage costs 20-30 seconds but can gain minutes if conditions have shifted. The Finnish wax team will be ready. So will the Norwegians — they prepare backup skis for exactly this moment."

### Medal Contention Assessment (~35km)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "With 15 kilometres to go, here is my medal assessment:
> - **Gold favourite:** Klaebo (BIB 1) — if the group stays together, his finishing kick is unbeatable. But fatigue from 5 events in 13 days is the unknown.
> - **Breakaway threat:** Nyenget (BIB 3) — if he attacks and sustains a solo effort, his classic power could make the gap insurmountable. He beat everyone by 13.8 seconds in Oberhof.
> - **The Patient Champion:** Niskanen (BIB 7) — the defending Olympic 50km gold medalist. At 34, he knows exactly how to pace this race. Beat Klaebo by 12.9 seconds at Falun. If he has saved his energy, the final 10km belong to him.
> - **The Comeback King:** Iversen (BIB 4) — the 50km Classic World Champion. 'Now they can't avoid me.' If this comes to a three-way Norwegian battle on the climbs, Iversen has the classic pedigree to be the last man standing.
> - **Dark horse:** Korostelev (BIB 12) — if the 22-year-old neutral athlete is still in the lead group at 35km, his climbing ability and youth could produce the surprise of the Games."
