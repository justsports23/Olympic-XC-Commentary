# STORYLINE 1: THE MARATHON TRADITION — 102 YEARS OF THE KING OF DISTANCES

## Opening Hook

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Welcome to the crown jewel of Nordic skiing. The men's 50 kilometres. The longest, the hardest, the most revered endurance event in Winter Olympic history. Every four years since the very first Winter Olympics in 1924, the finest cross-country skiers on earth have lined up for this ultimate test of body and will. Today, in the Italian Dolomites, a new chapter of that 102-year story will be written."

## Historical Foundation

The men's 50km cross-country skiing race has been contested at every Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural edition in Chamonix, France, in 1924. It is the oldest continuously contested long-distance event in Winter Olympic history. [Source: Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/chamonix-1924/results/cross-country-skiing)

The first Olympic 50km champion was **Thorleif Haug** of Norway, who won with a time of 3 hours, 44 minutes, and 32 seconds in violent, icy cold winds beneath the shadow of Mont Blanc. Haug led a Norwegian sweep of the top four positions. The last-placed finisher arrived 2 hours and 30 minutes after Haug. [Source: Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/haug-excels-in-the-shadow-of-mont-blanc)

Haug was the undisputed star of those inaugural Games, winning all three Nordic skiing events: the 18km, the 50km, and the Nordic combined. He remains one of the foundational legends of Winter Olympic sport. [Source: Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thorleif-Haug)

# STORYLINE 2: CLASSIC TECHNIQUE EXPLAINED

## The Basics for New Viewers

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "For those watching cross-country skiing for the first time, let me explain what you are about to see. This is a classic technique race. That means the skiers' feet must stay in parallel tracks carved into the snow. They cannot skate — they cannot push their skis sideways like a speed skater. They must move forward in a straight-ahead motion, which is the original, the traditional, the purist's way to ski."

### Diagonal Stride

The **diagonal stride** is the fundamental classic technique. It resembles an exaggerated walk or run on skis. The skier pushes off one ski while gliding forward on the other, with opposite arm and leg working in unison — right arm and left leg forward together, then left arm and right leg. The motion generates propulsion through a combination of the wax or skin grip zone catching the snow (the "kick") and the pole plant providing additional push. [Source: REI](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/how-to-cross-country-ski.html)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Watch their feet and hands. When the right foot pushes back, the left hand drives the pole into the snow. It is a beautifully coordinated motion — when it is done well, it looks effortless. When fatigue sets in at 40 kilometres, it looks like a desperate struggle."

### Double Poling

**Double poling** is a technique where the skier plants both poles simultaneously and propels forward using the arms, shoulders, and core, without kicking with the legs. It is primarily used on flat and downhill terrain. The skier compresses the upper body forward and down, driving through the poles, then springs back upright to prepare for the next stroke. [Source: NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-glossary)

A key evolution in modern classic skiing: double poling has become increasingly dominant, especially since the fluorocarbon wax ban. Elite skiers now double pole through sections that would have required diagonal stride 20 years ago, using their immense upper-body strength.

> **KEY STAT BOX:**
> | Technique | Used When | Primary Muscles |
> |-----------|-----------|----------------|
> | Diagonal Stride | Uphills, gradual inclines | Legs, arms, core (alternating) |
> | Double Pole | Flats, gentle descents | Arms, shoulders, core, back |
> | Herringbone | Steep uphills | Legs (V-position), arms |
> | Kick Double Pole | Moderate hills | One leg kick + both arms |

### Herringbone

The **herringbone** is used on steep climbs where diagonal stride cannot generate enough grip. The skier angles the skis outward in a V-shape and walks or runs straight uphill, stepping from ski to ski. It is energy-expensive and slow but sometimes unavoidable. In elite racing, it is a sign that a climb is exceptionally steep — or that a skier's wax has failed. [Source: Snow Australia Interschools](https://www.interschools.com.au/cross-country-classic-techniques/)

### Classic vs. Freestyle: The Key Difference

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "If you watch the sprint events or the skiathlon, you see freestyle technique — what we call skating. Skating is faster. The skier pushes the ski sideways, like an ice skater. Classic technique is slower but requires more finesse. The grip under the ski — whether wax or a synthetic skin — must be calibrated perfectly. Too much grip and you stick to the snow. Too little and you slip on the climbs. It is a razor's edge."

# STORYLINE 3: VAL DI FIEMME AS A VENUE

## A Cathedral of Nordic Skiing

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "This valley — the Val di Fiemme, in the heart of Trentino in northern Italy — is sacred ground for Nordic skiing. Along with Holmenkollen in Oslo, it is one of the very few places on earth that has hosted every major Nordic skiing event: World Championships, World Cup, Tour de Ski, and now, the Olympic Games."

## World Championship History

Val di Fiemme has hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships three times: in **1991**, **2003**, and **2013**. [Source: Fiemme World Cup](https://www.fiemmeworldcup.com/en/organising-committee/fiemme-world-championships)

- **1991**: The first time the Nordic World Championships were held south of the Alps in the history of the sport. A milestone moment for Italian skiing. The event took place from 7-17 February 1991. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Nordic_World_Ski_Championships_1991)
- **2003**: The Championships returned to Val di Fiemme, held from 18 February to 1 March 2003, for its second hosting. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Nordic_World_Ski_Championships_2003)
- **2013**: Val di Fiemme hosted for a third time, cementing its status as one of the premier Nordic skiing venues in the world. [Source: Fiemme World Cup](https://www.fiemmeworldcup.com/en/organising-committee/fiemme-world-championships/Fiemme-2013)

The 2025 Nordic World Ski Championships were held in Trondheim, Norway, just 11 months before these Olympic Games. Many of the athletes racing today competed in Trondheim and will carry the form and fitness from that competition into this race.

## Tour de Ski — The Iconic Final Climb

Val di Fiemme has hosted stages of every single edition of the Tour de Ski since the multi-stage race was created in 2007. It is the only venue to appear in all editions. The final stage traditionally concludes with the legendary **Final Climb up Alpe Cermis** — a 3.6km ascent with an average gradient of 11.6% and a maximum gradient of 28.0%, gaining 425 meters of elevation up an alpine ski slope skied in reverse. [Source: ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/long-distance/tour-de-ski-all-about-the-final-climb-alpe-cermis/)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Many of the athletes racing today have suffered up the Alpe Cermis climb on the final day of the Tour de Ski. They know this valley. They know the air. They know the snow. This is not a new Olympic venue built from scratch — this is a living, breathing competition arena that has tested the world's best for decades."

## The Course at Tesero

The Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium sits at an altitude of approximately **830 metres** above sea level, with a spectator capacity of **15,000**. The venue offers **19 kilometres** of prepared trails for both classical and skating techniques. [Source: NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-venue)

For the 50km race, athletes will complete multiple laps of the course, passing through the stadium zone several times, giving spectators and television viewers repeated views of the action.

# STORYLINE 4: WAX VS. SKIN SKIS — THE BIGGEST TACTICAL GAMBLE IN THE RACE

## The Invisible Decision That Shapes Everything

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Before a single stride is taken today, the most important decision of the race has already been made — by the wax technicians working in the team cabins since before dawn. In classic skiing, the bottom of the ski must do two contradictory things: it must grip the snow when the skier pushes down, so they can propel forward. But it must also glide freely when the skier lifts their weight, so they can slide forward without friction. Balancing those two things — grip and glide — is the great art of ski preparation."

## Kick Wax: The Traditional Approach

Traditional **kick wax** is applied to the "grip zone" — the section of the ski under the skier's foot. When the skier compresses their weight onto the ski, the wax bites into the snow crystals, providing traction. When the weight is released, the ski glides forward. Different waxes are formulated for different snow temperatures and crystal types. [Source: REI](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/grip-waxing-crosscountry-skis.html)

**Advantages of kick wax:**
- When perfectly matched to conditions, offers superior glide
- Lighter ski overall
- Can be reapplied or adjusted at feed stations in emergencies

**Disadvantages of kick wax:**
- Extremely temperature-sensitive — a 2-3 degree change in snow temperature can render a wax choice ineffective
- Requires expert technicians and decades of institutional knowledge
- If conditions change mid-race, there is no easy fix
- Can "ice up" in certain conditions, destroying both grip and glide

## Skin Skis: The Modern Alternative

**Skin skis** replace kick wax with a strip of synthetic mohair or similar material embedded in the grip zone of the ski. The fibres grip in one direction (providing kick) and lie flat in the other (allowing glide). [Source: Fresh Air Experience](https://blog.freshairexp.com/https-freshairexp-ca-skin-skis-buyers-guide/)

**Advantages of skin skis:**
- Consistent grip across a wide range of conditions
- No risk of wax failure
- Simpler logistics — no last-minute wax cabin anxiety

**Disadvantages of skin skis:**
- Slightly slower glide than perfectly waxed skis
- The speed penalty compounds over 50km — potentially 30-90 seconds over the full distance
- Less fine-tuning possible

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "In a 50 kilometre race, every second of glide lost adds up. Over thousands of strides, a small glide penalty becomes a large time penalty. But if your wax fails — if the temperature shifts and your kick wax turns to ice — you lose far more than a few seconds. You lose the race."

## The Fluorocarbon Ban — A Game Changer

Since the **2023-24 season**, the FIS has implemented a full ban on fluorinated ski waxes, following years of environmental and health concerns about perfluorinated compounds (PFCs/PFAS). [Source: FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/inside-fis/news/2024-25/fis-widens-scope-of-fluor-testing-after-successful-first-season)

The ban was formally declared in March 2023 and took full effect for the 2023-24 competition season. Skis are now tested for fluorine content at events. [Source: US Ski & Snowboard](https://usskiandsnowboard.org/fluorocarbon-wax-ban)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "The fluorocarbon ban changed the equation. Fluoro waxes were wonder products — they repelled moisture, repelled dirt, and made skis glide like nothing else. Without them, the performance gap between kick wax and skin skis has narrowed. The best hydrocarbon waxes are good, but they are not as forgiving as the old fluoro products. That has made skin skis a more viable choice at the elite level, especially in tricky conditions."

The end of the "fluor era" has seen racers switch to hydrocarbon waxes that do not repel moisture or dirt as well as fluorinated products, meaning skis do not glide as smoothly as they once did. [Source: Grist](https://grist.org/culture/the-olympics-are-ditching-pfas-waxes-and-the-ridiculous-speed-they-gave-skiers/)

In difficult snow conditions near 0 degrees Celsius, even world-class athletes have competed on waxless (skin) skis at World Cup level. [Source: XC Ski Masters](https://www.xcskimasters.com/best-skin-skis.html)

> **KEY STAT BOX:**
> | Wax Decision | Kick Wax | Skin Skis |
> |-------------|----------|-----------|
> | Glide Speed | Faster (when perfect) | Slightly slower |
> | Grip Reliability | Variable (weather-dependent) | Very consistent |
> | Risk Level | High (if conditions change) | Low |
> | Over 50km | ~0-30 sec advantage (good wax) | ~30-90 sec slower (est.) |
> | Fluoro Ban Impact | Reduced wax advantage | Made skins more competitive |
> | Ski Change Option | Possible at feed zones | Possible at feed zones |

# STORYLINE 5: THE ATHLETES — FAVORITES, DARK HORSES, AND STORIES THAT MATTER

### Pre-Race Favorites Block

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Let's meet the men who will contest this 50 kilometres today. 65 athletes from 33 nations are on the start list. From Norway to Haiti, from Kazakhstan to Colombia — the breadth of this field is remarkable. Here are the names you need to know..."

#### Favorite #1: Johannes Hoesflot KLAEBO (NOR) — BIB 1
- **Current Form:** 5 gold medals at these Games (skiathlon, sprint, 10km, relay, team sprint). 116+ World Cup victories. Record 5th Tour de Ski title. Leading all World Cup standings.
- **Why He Wins:** Unmatched finishing kick in a mass start. Won the 50km Classic at both Oslo 2024 and Lahti 2025. Won the 50km Mass Start Free at WCH Trondheim 2025 in 1:57:47.1. If the race comes together for a sprint finish, nobody beats this man.
- **Key Stat:** Attempting a 6th gold medal at a single Winter Olympics — never done before in any sport. Career Olympic total would reach 11 golds.
- **The 50km Ghost:** DNF in Beijing 2022. Disqualified at WCH Oberstdorf 2021 for contact with Bolshunov after crossing the line first. The Olympic 50km is the one prize that has eluded him. [Source: NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/50km-race-johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-could-sweep-mens-cross-country-skiing-olympic-gold)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Johannes Klaebo has won everything there is to win in cross-country skiing — except an Olympic 50km gold. He DNFed in Beijing. He was disqualified in Oberstdorf. This race has haunted him. Today, in the final event of these Games, he gets one last chance to slay that ghost."

#### Favorite #2: Martin Loewstroem NYENGET (NOR) — BIB 3
- **Current Form:** Won both World Cup classic races this season (10km Classic at Ruka and Oberhof, the latter by a devastating 13.8 seconds). Relay gold and skiathlon bronze at these Games.
- **Why He Podiums:** Arguably the strongest pure classic distance skier in the field. Won the 50km Classic at Oslo in 2022. Pushed Klaebo to within 0.5 seconds in the Lahti 50km Classic. Described as "one of the few skiers capable of attacking early and sustaining a solo effort."
- **Key Stat:** First WC victory — the Oslo 50km Classic in March 2022 — came two weeks after his father's death. He dedicated the win to his late father. [Source: InsideTheGames](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1120173/nyenget-first-cross-country-world-cup)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Nyenget is the man the Norwegians fear most — because he is Norwegian. His classic technique is the best in the world. If he attacks on the climbs and breaks away, even Klaebo may not be able to follow. His first World Cup victory came at the 50km Classic in Oslo, two weeks after burying his father. Today, at 33, in his first Olympics, the 50km classic is the race he was born to run."

#### Favorite #3: Iivo NISKANEN (FIN) — BIB 7
- **Current Form:** Won the Falun 10km Classic by 12.9 seconds over Klaebo in January. Won the Distance Crystal Globe last season. Classic form is peaking at exactly the right time.
- **Why He Podiums:** Defending Olympic 50km champion from PyeongChang 2018. 3 Olympic golds, 5 Olympic medals total. Patient racing style suits 50km perfectly. After Finland's bitter 4th-place relay — "a bitter taste" — he races with redemption on his mind.
- **Key Stat:** Beat Klaebo by 12.9 seconds at Falun in pure classic technique — weeks before the Olympics. [Source: All Things Nordic](https://all-things-nordic.com/2025/02/15/fis-cross-country-skiing-world-cup-falun-niskanen-wins-mens-interval-start-classic/)

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Iivo Niskanen is the defending Olympic 50km champion. In PyeongChang, he sat in the pack for 40 kilometres, changed to fresh skis, and pulled away for gold. He is 34 years old. This may be his last Olympics. And three weeks ago, he beat Klaebo by 13 seconds in pure classic technique. When Niskanen is on his classic skis, he is the most dangerous man alive."

#### Also Watch: Emil IVERSEN (NOR) — BIB 4

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "Emil Iversen was dropped from the Norwegian World Cup squad earlier this season. His response? He won his way back through the Norwegian Cup, stood in front of the cameras, and said: 'Now they can't avoid me.' He is the reigning 50km Classic World Champion from Oberstdorf 2021. He is 34 years old. This is his last dance. And the 50km classic is the one race where Iversen believes he can beat anyone — including Klaebo."

### Dark Horse Block

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "But this is the 50 kilometres. This event has a long history of surprises. Here are two athletes who could shock the world today..."

#### Dark Horse #1: Savelii KOROSTELEV (AIN) — BIB 12
- **Why Watch:** The 22-year-old Russian, competing as a neutral athlete, was 4th in the Olympic skiathlon — agonizingly close to a medal. 4th on the Alpe Cermis final climb at Tour de Ski. His progressive trajectory — getting stronger as races get longer — is the calling card of a born distance racer. Won double gold at the 2022 Junior World Championships before being locked out of international competition for nearly three years.
- **Controversy:** Barents Observer investigation revealed links to Russia's armed forces, adding political scrutiny to his participation. [Source: Barents Observer](https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/news/olympic-hopeful-savelii-korostelev-has-link-to-russias-armed-forces/441946)

#### Dark Horse #2: Mathis DESLOGES (FRA) — BIB 6
- **Why Watch:** Three silver medals at these Games (skiathlon, 10km free, relay) — the most decorated non-Norwegian at Milano Cortina 2026. The 23-year-old Frenchman was a U23 World Champion 18 months ago. Now he is the revelation of the Olympics. His broken medal from over-celebrating the skiathlon is the symbol of a man riding the wave of his life. Can the fairytale extend to a 4th medal?
- **The Risk:** Has never raced a 50km at the elite level. Classic technique over marathon distance is uncharted territory.

### Key Storylines to Watch

1. **Klaebo's Quest — 6 for 6:** Klaebo has won all 5 events he has entered at these Games. A 6th gold would be the most by any athlete at a single Winter Olympics — ever. His career total would reach 11 Olympic golds, pulling clear as the all-time Winter Olympic leader. But the 50km has been his Olympic ghost — DNF Beijing, DQ Oberstdorf. This is redemption. [Source: NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/50km-race-johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-could-sweep-mens-cross-country-skiing-olympic-gold)

2. **Pellegrino's Farewell — BIB 10:** Federico Pellegrino, Italy's sprint legend, races his final event on home snow. Four Olympic medals. A World Championship gold. Over 60 World Cup podiums. Retirement date: February 22 — tomorrow. The man who wept at the relay bronze will ski 50km through the Italian Dolomites one last time. The Tesero crowd will be on its feet from start to finish. *"The ultimate goal of my career,"* he called these home Games. [Source: Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/exclusive-federico-pellegrino-cross-country-ski-mico-2026-ultimate-goal)

3. **Savart's Story — BIB 62:** Stevenson Savart, Haiti's first Olympic cross-country skier, born in Delmas, adopted at age 3 by a French family in the Vosges mountains. His skiathlon finish drew one of the loudest ovations of the Games. The 50km will be his fourth and final event. *"Athletes from so-called 'exotic' countries can do winter sports without being laughed at. We have to be taken seriously."* [Source: Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/haiti-stevenson-savart-milano-cortina-2026)

4. **The Moch Brothers Birthday Special — BIBs 16 & 38:** Jakob Elias Moch (BIB 38) turns 20 years old today — on race day. He is a CU Boulder freshman racing alongside his older brother Friedrich (BIB 16, age 25). Two golds at the Youth Olympics. 21st on his World Cup debut.

5. **Ben Ogden — Sprint King Meets the Marathon (BIB 27):** The Vermont knitter who ended America's 50-year men's XC medal drought with sprint silver now attempts the 50km — 2.5 times the longest race he has ever competed in. Can the man who finished 0.87 seconds behind Klaebo in a 3-minute sprint survive a 2-hour marathon?

### Wax Report Integration

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "We are hearing from the wax cabins that conditions today are critical for the wax-versus-skin decision. With 65 athletes grinding over the course for two-plus hours, conditions will change. The Norwegian team historically has the best wax technicians in the sport — that advantage compounds over 50km. Watch to see who has chosen skin skis for the security of consistent grip, and who has gambled on traditional kick wax for the speed advantage."

### Start Positioning Preview

> **BROADCASTER READ:** "In a mass start, the seeded athletes will line up at the front. Watch for Klaebo in BIB 1 and Amundsen in BIB 2 to position themselves in the first two rows. Niskanen, the defending champion in BIB 7, will be there too. The key is the first 200 metres — getting through the first corners without tangling poles or losing position. With 65 athletes funnelling into narrow tracks, the first 30 seconds will be chaos."
