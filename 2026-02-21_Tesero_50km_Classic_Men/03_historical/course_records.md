## Expected Winning Time for 2026 Olympic 50km Classic

- **Estimated range:** ~2:00:00 to 2:15:00
- The most directly comparable historical reference is Olsson's 2013 WCH classical winning time of 2:10:41.4
- The 2003 freestyle time of 1:54:25.3 is faster because freestyle (skating) technique is inherently faster than classical
- The 1991 freestyle time of 2:03:31.6 suggests conditions and course can vary significantly
- Conditions on race day (temperature, snow hardness, humidity, wind) will significantly affect times
- Mass start dynamics may produce slightly slower times than interval start due to tactical pacing and pack skiing
