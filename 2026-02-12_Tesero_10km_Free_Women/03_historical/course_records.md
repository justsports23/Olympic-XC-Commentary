# Course Records — Tesero / Val di Fiemme (Women's Distance Events)

The Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium (officially the Cross Country and Biathlon Center Fabio Canal) at Lago di Tesero sits at approximately 830m elevation and features loops ranging from 1.6 to 3.75 km with highly varied terrain including steep climbs, technical descents, and tight bends. ([NBC Olympics — Tesero Venue Guide](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-venue))

**Important caveat:** The course configurations at Tesero have been modified across different editions of the World Championships, World Cup, and Tour de Ski. As a result, direct time comparisons between eras are imprecise. Course modifications for the 2026 Olympics may further alter the layout. Formal "course records" are not officially maintained by FIS across different event configurations at the same venue.

## Tour de Ski Final Climb (Alpe Cermis) — Women's Stage Records

The Tour de Ski final stage at Val di Fiemme is run on a different course than the standard Tesero stadium loops. It covers 9.0 km total, culminating in the 3.6 km climb up the Alpe Cermis alpine slope (average gradient 11.6%, maximum 28.0%). The format changed from pursuit to mass start beginning in the 2019/20 season. Course routing of the initial flat/rolling section has also varied year to year, making direct time comparisons across editions approximate.

### Women's Final Climb Stage Times (Mass Start Era, 2020--Present)

| Season | Date | Stage Winner | Time | 2nd Place | 3rd Place |

**Fastest women's Final Climb stage time (mass start era):** **35:59.0** by Therese Johaug (NOR), January 5, 2025. Johaug dominated the field, finishing 25.5 seconds clear of second-placed Astrid Oyre Slind. ([FIS-Ski — Johaug Wins Final Climb 2025](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/johaug-wins-final-climb-to-equal-kowalczyk-on-four-tour-de-ski-titles))

**Note:** The 2024/25 course underwent modifications, which may explain the significantly faster finishing time relative to adjacent years. ([FIS-Ski — Tour de Ski Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=CC&raceid=46785))

### Women's Tour de Ski Final Climb — Pursuit Era Notable Times

In the pursuit era (2006/07 through 2018/19), the first skier to the top was the overall Tour winner. Times reflected the accumulated gap from prior stages, making them less useful for course-speed comparisons. Official pursuit-start finishing times for specific editions are available through the [FIS Results Database](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/calendar-results.html).

## Olympic Women's 10km Freestyle — Historical Benchmark Times

For context on what winning times look like for the Olympic women's 10km, here are times from recent freestyle editions (run at different venues):

| Year | Venue | Technique | Gold Medalist | Winning Time |
|------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 2018 | PyeongChang (Alpensia, ~800m elev.) | Freestyle | Ragnhild Haga (NOR) | 25:00.5 |
| 2010 | Vancouver (Whistler, ~850m elev.) | Freestyle | Charlotte Kalla (SWE) | [DATA NOT FOUND] |

And for classic technique at different venues:

| Year | Venue | Technique | Gold Medalist | Winning Time |
|------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 2022 | Beijing (Zhangjiakou, ~1,700m elev.) | Classic | Therese Johaug (NOR) | 28:06.3 |
| 2014 | Sochi (Krasnaya Polyana, ~600m elev.) | Classic | Justyna Kowalczyk (POL) | 28:17.8 |

([Olympics.com — Beijing 2022 Women's 10km Classic Results](https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/beijing-2022/results/cross-country-skiing/women-10km-classic)) ([Olympics.com — PyeongChang 2018 Ladies' 10km Free Results](https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/pyeongchang-2018/results/cross-country-skiing/ladies-10km-free))

**Note:** Freestyle times are typically faster than classic times over the same distance. The PyeongChang 2018 10km freestyle winning time of 25:00.5 at a similar elevation (~800m vs ~830m at Tesero) may serve as the best approximate benchmark for expected winning times at the 2026 Tesero 10km freestyle race, though course profile, snow conditions, and field depth will all play a role.
