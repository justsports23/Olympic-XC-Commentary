## Key Storylines and Historical Notes

### Technique Alternation
Since the reintroduction of the 10km in 2002, the technique has alternated between classic and freestyle:
- **Classic:** 2002, 2006, 2014, 2022
- **Freestyle:** 2010, 2018, **2026**

The 2026 race at Tesero will be the fourth time the Olympic women's 10km is contested in freestyle. Previous freestyle editions were won by Charlotte Kalla (2010) and Ragnhild Haga (2018).

### Dominant Nations
- **Norway** has produced the most gold medalists in the modern era (Johaug 2022, Haga 2018, Skari 2002)
- **Soviet Union/Russia** dominated the original era (1956--1988), winning 6 of 9 gold medals
- **Finland** won the first-ever Olympic women's cross-country event (Wideman, 1952) with a clean sweep of all three medals
- **Poland** (Kowalczyk, 2014) and **Estonia** (Smigun, 2006) are the only non-Scandinavian/non-Soviet nations to win gold in the modern era

### Notable Performances
- **Therese Johaug (NOR)** won the 2022 Beijing 10km classic by a razor-thin margin of 0.4 seconds over Kerttu Niskanen (FIN), having trailed at multiple split points ([Olympics.com — Johaug Wins 10km Classic Gold](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/medals-update-norways-therese-johaug-wins-10km-classic-gold))

- **Marit Bjoergen (NOR)** earned a medal in four consecutive Olympic 10km events (2006 silver, 2010 bronze, 2014 DNF, 2018 bronze tie), cementing her status as the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time with 15 total medals
- **Krista Parmakoski (FIN)** is the only athlete to have medaled in the last two Olympic 10km races (bronze 2018, bronze 2022)
- The bronze medal tie at PyeongChang 2018 between Bjoergen and Parmakoski (both 25:32.4) was the first tied medal in Olympic women's 10km history

### Cortina d'Ampezzo Connection
The 1956 Winter Olympics were held in Cortina d'Ampezzo, just 150km from Tesero. The Soviet Union's Lyubov Kozyreva won the women's 10km at those Games. Seventy years later, the region again hosts the Winter Olympics with the cross-country events at the nearby Tesero venue.
