## Format Description

The Women's 10km Interval Start Free is one of only two cross-country skiing events at the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics (along with the Men's 10km) to use the interval start format. Athletes start individually at 30-second intervals and race against the clock. The athlete with the fastest cumulative time wins -- unlike mass start events, the first to cross the finish line is not necessarily the winner.

### Start Order Protocol

The start order is determined by the FIS Distance World Cup standings. Athletes ranked 15--30 in the distance standings start first, followed by an alternating sequence between the top-15 ranked athletes and those ranked 30--45. The remainder of the field follows. This structure ensures that the top-seeded athletes start later in the race, when course conditions and timing references are more established.

### Historic Significance

Milano Cortina 2026 marks the first time in Olympic history that men and women race the same distances in cross-country skiing. Previously, women's distance events were shorter (e.g., 7.5 km individual). The equalization of distances to 10 km for both genders is a landmark moment for the sport.

## Competition Context

### World Cup Overall Leader

**Jessie Diggins (USA)** arrives at the 2026 Olympics as the leader of the Overall World Cup standings. Diggins won the 2025 FIS World Cup Crystal Globes for both the distance and overall classifications. She claimed her third Tour de Ski title in January 2026 and is widely considered the foremost favorite for this event. Diggins won the World Championship title in the 10 km freestyle in 2023 in Planica.

The 2026 Games will be Diggins' fourth and final Olympics. She has announced plans to retire at the end of the 2025/2026 season. Her Olympic medal collection includes gold (PyeongChang 2018, team sprint), silver (Beijing 2022, 30 km freestyle), and bronze (Beijing 2022, sprint freestyle).
