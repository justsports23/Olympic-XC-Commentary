### Mid-Mountain Conditions (Tesero Pampeago, 2088 m)

At higher elevations surrounding Tesero, the forecast is colder and drier. Temperatures at mid-mountain level are expected to remain below freezing (max -2 C on Wednesday afternoon, min -6 C on Tuesday night). Snow forecast is mostly dry, with approximately 4 cm (1.6 in) of new snow expected on Friday the 13th after 10 PM -- after the race. Wind will be generally light. ([Snow-Forecast -- Tesero Pampeago](https://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/TeseroPampeago/6day/mid))

**Note:** The race course at approximately 830 m elevation will be warmer than mid-mountain conditions, but the mid-mountain data provides useful context for snow transformation and overnight freezing cycles.

## Comparison: Skiathlon Conditions (February 7, 2026)

The Women's 10km + 10km Skiathlon on February 7 provides a useful reference for conditions at the same venue earlier in the competition:

| Condition | Skiathlon (Feb. 7) | 10km Free (Feb. 12) Forecast |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| **Sky** | Cloudy | Mostly cloudy |
| **Wind** | 4 MPH (6.4 km/h) | 4--19 MPH (6--31 km/h) |
| **Temperature** | 41 F (5 C) | 37--44 F (3--7 C) |
| **Humidity** | 94% | ~85--100% |
| **Precipitation** | Snow spray / wet conditions | 70% chance, trace amounts |
| **Snow Character** | Wet, soft, "punishing" conditions | Expected: transformed, possibly damp at race time |

The skiathlon was raced in notably wet and difficult conditions, with "snow spraying from skis" and challenging visibility. February 12 conditions may be slightly cooler with similar cloud cover and high humidity, though potentially drier overall.

## February Climate Context for Tesero

Historical averages for mid-February in Tesero provide baseline expectations:

| Metric | February Average |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Average High** | 1.4 C / 34.5 F |
| **Average Low** | -7.3 C / 18.7 F (for Feb 11--20 specifically) |
| **Average Precipitation** | ~59 mm for the month |
| **Days with Precipitation** | ~12 days per month |
| **Average Humidity** | ~85% (most humid month) |
| **Average Wind Speed** | 6.8 km/h (windiest month) |
| **Sunshine Hours** | 5--8 hours per day |

([Climate-Data.org -- Tesero February](https://en.climate-data.org/europe/italy/trentino-alto-adige-suedtirol/tesero-113118/t/february-2/), [Weather-and-Climate.com -- Tesero February](https://weather-and-climate.com/tesero-trentino-alto-adige-it-February-averages), [Wanderlog -- Tesero February](https://wanderlog.com/weather/15074/2/tesero-weather-in-february))

**The forecast high of 7 C / 44 F for February 12 is significantly warmer than the historical average high of 1.4 C.** This above-average warmth suggests the snow surface will be in transformation -- softening during the afternoon race window and potentially becoming wet and granular. This has major implications for wax selection.

## Snow Conditions Assessment

### Snow Surface

The Tesero course relies heavily on **artificial (machine-made) snow** produced by the venue's snowmaking system, which draws water from the adjacent Avisio river. The system was upgraded for the 2026 Olympics. ([Visit Fiemme](https://www.visitfiemme.it/en/activities/skiing/cross-country-skiing), [NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-venue))

**Key snow character factors for February 12:**

1. **Artificial snow base:** Machine-made snow crystals are harder, rounder, and more abrasive than natural snow. This causes faster base wear and requires more durable wax formulations. ([HWK Ski Wax](https://www.skiwax.tirol/en/ski-wax-and-temperature-adapting-to-weather-conditions/))
2. **Transformation cycle:** With overnight lows near -2 C and afternoon highs reaching 7 C, the snow will undergo a freeze-thaw cycle. By the 13:00 CET race start, the surface will likely be in active transformation -- transitioning from frozen morning conditions to softening afternoon conditions.
3. **Moisture content:** With 94--100% humidity and a 70% chance of light precipitation, the snow surface will have high moisture content, creating "wet" glide conditions.
4. **Previous races:** The course will have been used for multiple Olympic events by February 12 (skiathlon on Feb. 7, sprints on Feb. 10), meaning the track will be well-compacted and groomed, with established ruts in the skating lanes.

### Estimated Snow Temperature at Race Time

With air temperature forecast around 3--7 C at 13:00 CET and high humidity, the snow surface temperature is estimated at:
- **Snow temperature (est.):** 0 C to -1 C (at or near the melting point)
- The artificial snow base may maintain slightly colder temperatures below the surface due to its density.

## Wax Recommendations

### Conditions Summary for Wax Selection

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Air Temperature** | 3--7 C (37--44 F) at race time |
| **Snow Temperature** | ~0 C to -1 C (est.) |
| **Snow Type** | Artificial/machine-made, transformed, potentially wet |
| **Humidity** | Very high (85--100%) |
| **Precipitation** | Possible trace amounts during race |
| **Course Surface** | Well-compacted, abrasive artificial snow |

### Glide Wax Recommendations

For these **warm, wet, high-humidity conditions on artificial snow**, the following wax categories are appropriate:

- **Temperature range target:** 0 C to -4 C snow temperature, 0 C to +10 C air temperature (warm/wet range)
- **Recommended wax type:** High-fluorocarbon warm-range glide waxes or modern fluoro-free alternatives
  - **Swix PS8 Red** or equivalent: Designed for 0 C to +4 C air temperature, wet/transformed snow ([Swix](https://www.swixsport.com))
  - **Wend MID wax**: Covers -12 C to -2 C for mixed and artificial snow conditions ([Wend Waxworks](https://wendperformance.com/tech-library/ski-snowboard-wax-snow-iron-temp-charts/))
  - For the slightly colder early-race window: **Swix PS6 Blue** (covers -6 C to -12 C) as a base layer may provide durability on the abrasive artificial snow surface
- **Structure:** A warm-snow linear structure pattern in the ski base will help break the suction caused by wet snow. A coarser structure is appropriate given the moisture content.
- **Graphite additive:** Consider graphite-infused wax or overlay for the abrasive artificial snow surface, which helps reduce static buildup and base wear. ([Fischer Sports](https://www.fischersports.com/blog/waxing-cross-country-skis-instructions-and-tips-for-cross-country-ski-care))

### Special Considerations for Artificial Snow

Due to the prevalence of artificial snow at Tesero, wax technicians should note:

1. **Wax one step colder** than air temperature suggests -- artificial snow's harder crystal structure behaves similarly to natural snow at colder temperatures. ([HWK Ski Wax](https://www.skiwax.tirol/en/ski-wax-and-temperature-adapting-to-weather-conditions/))
2. **Harder wax base layer** for durability -- the abrasive artificial crystals will strip soft wax more quickly over a 10 km race distance.
3. **Test extensively** -- the freeze-thaw transformation cycle means conditions at 13:00 may differ significantly from morning test sessions. Technicians should test as close to race time as possible.
4. The new underground wax preparation facilities at the renovated stadium provide improved working conditions for national team technicians. ([Fiemme World Cup](https://www.fiemmeworldcup.com/en/Winter-Olympic-Games-2026/Cross-country-stadium))

### Wax Brand Considerations

At the Olympic level, each national team's wax technicians will use proprietary formulations. The major ski wax brands supplying World Cup teams include:
- **Swix** (supplies many Scandinavian teams)
- **Toko** (Swiss-based, widely used)
- **Start** (Finnish, used by Finnish team)
- **Rex** (Finnish)
- **HWK** (German/Austrian)
- **Holmenkol** (German)

**Note on fluorocarbon regulations:** FIS implemented restrictions on fluorocarbon waxes starting in the 2023/2024 season. Teams are required to use waxes that comply with the FIS fluorocarbon testing protocol. This has leveled the playing field somewhat, as older high-fluorocarbon formulations that gave significant advantages in wet conditions are no longer permitted.

## Race Conditions Impact Assessment

### Impact on Race Dynamics

1. **Warm conditions favor:** Athletes with strong double-poling technique and efficient glide, as wet snow rewards smooth technique. Athletes whose teams have strong wax programs may gain a measurable advantage in these tricky transition conditions.

2. **Course degradation:** With 111 athletes starting at 30-second intervals, the race will span approximately 55 minutes of start times. Athletes starting later will face a more degraded course surface, as the softening snow will be churned by previous starters. However, later starters also benefit from knowing intermediate split times.

3. **Humidity and breathing:** The very high humidity (85--100%) may affect athletes' respiratory efficiency, particularly on the demanding climbs (390 m total climb).

4. **Start order advantage:** In warm, transforming conditions, earlier starters typically benefit from a firmer snow surface but have no reference times. Later starters face softer snow but have tactical information from split times. The optimal start position is a balance of these factors -- typically mid-pack provides the best combination of usable snow conditions and available split time data.

## Forecast Confidence

The weather forecast for February 12 is based on data available as of February 11, 2026 (one day before the race). Forecast confidence at this range is moderate-to-high for temperature and general conditions, but precipitation timing and wind strength can shift. Teams should monitor updated forecasts from:
