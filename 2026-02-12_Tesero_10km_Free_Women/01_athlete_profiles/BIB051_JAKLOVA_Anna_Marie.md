## Key Storylines
- **Olympic debut at 20:** Jaklova is one of the youngest competitors in the women's cross-country field at these Olympics, born in 2005. She is making the transition from junior/U23 to senior level competition at this Games. ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=263516))
- **Sprint talent in a distance race:** Jaklova's strongest results have come in sprint events, including winning the FESA Cup qualifying round. The 10 km free interval start is a different challenge — it tests sustained endurance rather than explosive speed. ([Nordic Magazine](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-planica-justine-gaillard-liv-coupat-and-julie-pierrel-in-the-top-5-of-the-sprint-skate-qualifier-camille-coupe-narrowly-missing-out-1205/))
- **Rapid development:** Jaklova went from 8th at Junior Worlds sprint in February 2025 to World Cup starts and an Olympic selection within a year. Competing for a Czech team that traditionally does not feature prominently in women's cross-country, she represents the next generation. ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=263516&type=result))
- **Freestyle advantage:** The 10 km free format suits her better than classic, given her FESA Cup sprint skate dominance.
