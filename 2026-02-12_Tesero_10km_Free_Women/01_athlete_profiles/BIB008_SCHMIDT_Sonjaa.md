## Personal Life & Background

- **Hometown/birthplace:** Born and raised in **Whitehorse, Yukon**, Canada. She grew up in the Yukon's skiing community and went through the local Cross Country Yukon program. She is the latest on a growing list of athletes from the Whitehorse skiing community, following former Olympians Dahria Beatty, Knute Johnsgaard, and Emily Nishikawa. ([CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-skier-named-to-canada-olympic-team-9.7023200); [Yukon News](https://yukon-news.com/2025/12/24/yukon-skier-makes-it-on-canadas-olympic-team/))
- **Family:** Schmidt has German family roots -- she has grandparents in Germany and plans to visit them between competitions. She was on skis before her first birthday. ([CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-skier-named-to-canada-olympic-team-9.7023200))
- **How she started skiing:** Schmidt says she was on skis before her first birthday -- *"And yeah, I haven't looked back since."* She grew up skiing in Whitehorse and began competing seriously around grade 11 or 12. After high school, she joined the **Alberta World Cup Academy** based out of Canmore, Alberta. She did the Calgary training program while attending school, and that is where she really started to improve and reach the world stage.

- **Education:** Attended school in Calgary while training with the Alberta World Cup Academy. Specific degree or institution details [DATA NOT FOUND].

- **Hobbies/interests:** In order to afford her ski career after not making the national team in 2023 and losing funding, Schmidt worked for several months as a **tree planter** during the off-season. Her coach, Alain Masson, commented: *"I guess tree planting is a very physical labour -- so maybe that's what has paid off for Sonjaa."* She also co-launched the **Yukon World Cup fund** with fellow Yukon skiers Sasha Masson and Derek Deuling to collect donations supporting athletes competing internationally. ([CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/whitehorse-skier-sonjaa-schmidt-u23-gold-1.7106671); [Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/2025/02/25/that-really-lit-a-spark-in-me-cross-country-skier-sonjaa-schmidt-is-a-rising-star-on-the-world-cup-circuit/))
- **Quotes:**
  - *"Anyone who knows my name, I feel like is a supporter. And so, yeah, I get to share this with, you know, the whole Yukon, and all my friends and family from all over."* -- on being named to Team Canada's Olympic roster. ([CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-skier-named-to-canada-olympic-team-9.7023200))
  - *"I felt lucky to have qualified in the first place... I have the same amount of chances as everyone else to win."* -- before winning U23 World Championship gold in 2024. ([CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/whitehorse-skier-sonjaa-schmidt-u23-gold-1.7106671))
- **Notable personal stories:** After not making the national team in 2023 and losing funding, Schmidt took up tree planting to fund her skiing career. She credits this physically demanding work as part of her training breakthrough. She went on to win U23 World Championship gold in sprint freestyle in 2024 -- the first Canadian woman to win a U23 world title in cross-country skiing. ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/2025/02/25/that-really-lit-a-spark-in-me-cross-country-skier-sonjaa-schmidt-is-a-rising-star-on-the-world-cup-circuit/); [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/whitehorse-skier-sonjaa-schmidt-u23-gold-1.7106671))
- **Personality/reputation:** Described by Team Canada as "a rising star on the World Cup circuit," Schmidt is part of a resurgence of Canadian women's cross-country skiing. Her underdog story -- from losing her national team spot and planting trees to becoming a U23 World Champion and Olympian -- has made her a compelling figure. She received Cross Country Yukon's first-ever International Excellence grant ($1,500) as an Olympic-bound athlete.
