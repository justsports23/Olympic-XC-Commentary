## The Person Behind the Skis

### The Most Inspirational Story in the Field

**Warning: This story will make you cry.**

Bruna Moura's journey to the Olympic start line is one of the most remarkable survival stories in modern sports.

### Chapter 1: The Heart Surgery (2011)
At **17 years old**, Moura was a promising **mountain biker** competing on the junior World Cup circuit, aiming for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Then a medical exam revealed a **heart condition requiring surgery**. Her mountain biking career was over. During the long cardiac recovery, Brazilian sports officials gifted her roller skiing equipment — and a new sporting life began.

### Chapter 2: The Car Crash (January 27, 2022)
**Eleven days after making the Olympic team for Beijing 2022**, Moura tested positive for COVID-19 and booked a van service from Switzerland to Munich for isolation. **The driver was killed in the accident.** Bruna was hospitalized with **fractures in her feet, arm, hips, and shoulder**.

She survived because she was **sitting in the back seat** — [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/33165884/brazilian-skier-bruna-moura-olympics-car-crash-italy). [Note: Other reports mention seatbelt and shoes as factors but these details have not been independently verified beyond the back seat position.]

She missed the Beijing Olympics — the Games she had qualified for just days earlier.

### Chapter 3: The Parasitic Infection
In 2023-24, as she fought to return to competition, Moura contracted **toxoplasmosis** — a parasitic infection that resulted in **25% loss of vision**. Another season destroyed by forces beyond her control.

### Chapter 4: The Comeback
She returned to snow in **November 2024**, competed at the **2025 World Championships in Trondheim**, and — despite chronic pain in her feet from the crash injuries — qualified for her **first-ever Olympic Games** at Milano Cortina 2026.

### In Her Own Words
*"Everything's burning. We ask ourselves, 'Why are we doing this?' Because it's too painful. But at the same time, it's like anger. You really want to do it. You really want to cross the finish line, just like if it's a big challenge. And if you cross the finish line, you are a hero."* — [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/bruna-moura-brazil-cross-country-skiing-car-crash-survivor-exclusive/)

*"I don't know whether I can continue skiing with the pain in my feet. So, I have to get to 2026."*
