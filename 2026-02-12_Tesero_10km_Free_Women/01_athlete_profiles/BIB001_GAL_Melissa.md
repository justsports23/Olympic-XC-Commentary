## Personal Life & Background

- **Hometown/birthplace:** Born near Annemasse, close to the Swiss border in the Haute-Savoie department of the French Alps. She trains on the Plateau des Glieres near La Roche-sur-Foron, the home base of her club, Ski Club Nordique du Pays Rochois. ([SPORTMAG](https://www.sportmag.fr/melissa-gal-au-debut-je-me-battais-avec-mes-skis/))
- **Family:** Melissa comes from a football-loving family rather than a skiing one. Her mother played football at senior level, her father coached goalkeepers at the club d'Ambilly, and her younger sister and brother also played football. She has said that her parents have not taken up skiing themselves -- only her mother has skied a little with her -- but when they can attend her races, they are her biggest supporters. ([SPORTMAG](https://www.sportmag.fr/melissa-gal-au-debut-je-me-battais-avec-mes-skis/))
- **How she started skiing:** Melissa originally played football as a child. One day, following a middle-distance running event at school, classmates invited her to try cross-country skiing at the Pays Rochois club when she was 11 or 12 years old. The beginnings were very difficult -- she did not know how to ski at all. But she enjoyed the atmosphere and continued.

- **Education:** [DATA NOT FOUND]
- **Hobbies/interests:** She has said her favorite activities outside skiing include spending time with her family and going out with friends. ([ski-nordique.net](https://www.ski-nordique.net/ski-est-tu-melissa-gal.6324358-508539.html))
- **Quotes:**
  - *"Au debut, je me battais avec mes skis"* ("At first, I was fighting with my skis") -- on her early struggles learning to ski as a teenager. ([SPORTMAG](https://www.sportmag.fr/melissa-gal-au-debut-je-me-battais-avec-mes-skis/))
  - *"I'm really looking forward to it! I'm expecting a crazy atmosphere over there."* -- ahead of the 2025 Trondheim World Championships. ([Nordic Magazine](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-melissa-gal-talks-to-nordic-magazine-on-the-eve-of-the-start-of-the-trondheim-worlds-im-expecting-a-crazy-atmosphere-0225/))
- **Notable personal stories:** In June 2024, Gal suffered a fractured hand and concussion in a bicycle crash, which disrupted her pre-season preparation. She reported persistent headaches during recovery and planned a full return to training by September 2024.

- **Personality/reputation:** Gal's unconventional path -- from a football family to elite skiing, discovered almost by accident through a school running event -- makes her one of the more unusual stories on the French team. She is a clubmate of French skiing legend Jean-Marc Gaillard at SCNP Rochois. ([ski-nordique.net](https://www.ski-nordique.net/ski-est-tu-melissa-gal.6324358-508539.html))
