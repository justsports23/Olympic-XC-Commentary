## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Upbringing
Emma Sofia Ribom was born on November 29, 1997, in **Kalix**, a small town in **Norrbotten County** in the far north of Sweden ([Wikipedia - Emma Ribom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Ribom)). Growing up in northern Sweden provided the ideal environment for winter sports. In a FIS interview, Ribom reflected warmly on her childhood: *"In Kalix you have a lot of opportunities to practice sport in general, of course the fact that we have long winters with natural snow and tracks from beginning of November till end of April, facilitate boys and girls who choose to practice winter sport in general. We are lucky with that. So I was a really happy child during my life there."* ([FIS Season Prep Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2022-23/emma-riborn))

### Family
- **Parents -- Johan and Kerstin Ribom:** Supported Emma's initial skiing pursuits, joining her for family activities during the long northern Swedish winters and attending key youth competitions ([Grokipedia - Emma Ribom](https://grokipedia.com/page/Emma_Ribom))
- **Younger brother:** Competed alongside Emma at the **Ungdomsvasan** in 2013, making it a family trip. Ribom recalled: *"I went to Mora with my whole family and also my little brother competed there. So it has been a nice family trip. We all had great fun in those days and of course I was really happy winning that important race during my youth skiing career."* ([FIS Season Prep Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2022-23/emma-riborn))

### How She Started Skiing
Ribom began skiing as a young child in Kalix, where the regional skiing traditions of Norrbotten -- characterized by community-oriented winter activities and well-maintained tracks -- played a significant role in fostering her initial interest. The area has long produced notable cross-country skiers due to its ideal snow conditions and cultural emphasis on endurance sports ([Grokipedia - Emma Ribom](https://grokipedia.com/page/Emma_Ribom)). As a child, she also participated in football and basketball alongside skiing ([Grokipedia - Emma Ribom](https://grokipedia.com/page/Emma_Ribom)). She competed in the **Ungdomsvasan** -- the most popular youth cross-country skiing race in Sweden -- and won it at age 15 in February 2013 ([FIS Season Prep Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2022-23/emma-riborn)).

### Current Residence
Ribom currently lives on **Froson**, the island just outside the city center of **Ostersund**, alongside fellow Swedish elite skiers Linn Svahn and Ebba Andersson ([Grokipedia - Emma Ribom](https://grokipedia.com/page/Emma_Ribom)). She is a longtime member of the **Pitea Elit SK** ski club ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=190533&type=result)).

### Personal Interests
Beyond skiing, Ribom has spoken about her love of the outdoors and family mountain walks. In her FIS interview, she fondly recalled family adventures: competing in the Olympics was a dream since childhood, *"when she put on skis for the first time in the little but idyllic Swedish city of Kalix. With her family, she had great fun doing long walks in the mountains and going skiing during winter season."* ([FIS Season Prep Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2022-23/emma-riborn))

### Training Philosophy
Ribom has emphasized the importance of consistency and planning, stating: *"I believe in having a well-defined and coherent plan and executing it diligently from start to finish."* She has a particular affinity for altitude training, noting: *"I feel good at high altitude, I like that type of training, and I have received good responses with camps."* ([ProXCskiing - Ribom embraces new challenges](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/ribom-embraces-new-challenges-after-a-stellar-winter-season/))

### Notable Personal Stories
- **Relay bonds:** Speaking about her 2016 Junior World Championships relay gold in Rasnov, Ribom said: *"It was really cool winning that relay with the team. Norway team was the favorite before the start, but we were able to beat them in the final sprint. All the other three girls (Elina Ronnlund, Ebba Andersson, Jenny Solin) are still a really good friend of mine because at that time we trained a lot together with the junior national team."* ([FIS Season Prep Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2022-23/emma-riborn))
- **Management:** Ribom is represented by **Hakanson United**, a Swedish sports management agency ([Hakanson United - Emma Ribom](https://hakansonunited.se/athletes/emma-ribom/))

## Key Storylines
- **Heartbreak over Olympic sprint omission:** Despite being one of Sweden's top sprinters, Ribom was the one left out of the four-person sprint squad for the Olympic classic sprint. She wrote on Instagram: "To be so close but still not get the confidence to compete in the Olympic sprint has broken my heart a little." This 10km Free race is her opportunity to show what she can do individually at these Games. ([ProXCskiing - Seven new Swedish skiers confirmed](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/seven-new-swedish-cross-country-skiers-confirmed-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/))
- **Tachycardia health scare:** At the 2025 Trondheim World Championships, Ribom suffered a sudden episode of tachycardia during the sprint quarterfinal. She described it as "a very unpleasant feeling" and acknowledged it "can absolutely happen again." She has since worked to overcome the issue mentally and physically. ([Nordic Mag - tachycardia episode](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-it-was-a-very-unpleasant-feeling-emma-ribom-looks-back-on-her-tachycardia-episode-at-the-trondheim-worlds-0606/))
- **Distance development:** Traditionally a pure sprinter, Ribom has been expanding her range into distance events. Her 2nd place in the 5km Free stage at Tour de Ski and multiple 10km-range results in the 10th-13th range suggest she can be competitive in this 10km Free event.
- **Illness at Tour de Ski:** Withdrew from the 20km Classic Pursuit at Tour de Ski (DNS on Jan 1) after waking up sick, and later DNF'd at Goms in the 20km Classic. Her fitness heading into the Olympics could be a factor.

- **Swedish relay gold medallist:** Part of the victorious Swedish 4x7.5km relay team at the 2025 Trondheim World Championships alongside Karlsson, Andersson, and Sundling.
