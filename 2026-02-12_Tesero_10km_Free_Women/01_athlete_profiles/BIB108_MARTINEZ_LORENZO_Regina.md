- **How she started skiing:** While studying medicine in Minnesota's brutal winters, she took up cross-country skiing to combat what she described as *"loneliness and lack of light."* She said: *"This is so, like, depressing. And medicine is already a hard thing to study. And to do it in a place where there's minimal sunlight and it's just very hostile."* Her friends skied recreationally, and she decided to try it as a bucket list item before graduating ([MN Daily](https://mndaily.com/266735/sports/youre-going-to-be-making-history-umn-medical-student-breaks-barriers-as-first-mexican-woman-to-compete-in-fis-world-ski-championships/))
- **German Madrazo connection:** After Googling how many Mexicans had competed in the Winter Olympics, she found German Madrazo (Mexico's 2018 Olympic XC skier) and reached out. A week later, Madrazo flew to Minneapolis to train her — for only the cost of his plane ticket. *"I didn't expect him to say, 'You should do it. I believe in you. I'll come train you like next week if you want.'"* Madrazo helped her overcome a fear of falling and became her first coach ([NBC Miami](https://www.nbcmiami.com/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/team-mexico-cross-country-skier-regina-martinez-lorenzo/3734736/); [Teton Gravity Research](https://www.tetongravity.com/meet-the-first-mexican-woman-to-qualify-in-olympic-cross-country/))

- **On how medicine helped her skiing:** *"Medicine is a long career with no instant gratification. You're constantly pushed to your limits, making critical decisions, facing difficult realities. That gave me emotional and mental strength, and I've transferred that directly to skiing."* ([The Star](https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/others/2026/01/21/olympics-mexican-cross-country-skier-martinez-breaks-barriers-on-path-to-games))
- **On being an Olympic representative for Mexico:** *"It's a privilege. I love it, it's obviously a responsibility. But I hope to carry it with grace and with poise through these Olympics...

## Key Storylines
Martinez Lorenzo is one of the most compelling stories in the entire Olympic field.

Frustrated by brutal winters, she Googled how many Mexicans had competed in the Winter Olympics, found German Madrazo (Mexico's 2018 Olympic XC skier), and reached out. He flew to Minneapolis and became her first coach. In just four years of professional training, she went from complete beginner to Mexico's first-ever female Olympic cross-country skier. She balanced ER residency shifts at Jackson Memorial Hospital with training and even dog-walking side jobs to fund her dream. She is the only medical doctor known to be competing in cross-country skiing at these Games. She joins Mexican teammates Allan Corona (XC) and Sarah Schleper (Alpine) in the delegation.
