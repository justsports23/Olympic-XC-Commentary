## Key Storylines
At just 18 years old, Sobol is one of the youngest athletes in the entire Olympic cross-country field. She hails from Rijeka and skis for SK Goranin in Delnice, representing Croatia's small but dedicated Nordic skiing community in a country far better known for alpine skiing (Janica and Ivica Kostelic). She was Croatia's flag bearer at the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics in Gangwon, signaling she is a rising star in Croatian winter sport. She also competes in biathlon, giving her versatility. Croatia sent 14 athletes to Milano Cortina across four sports, with Sobol and teammate Tena Hadzic carrying the Nordic flag.
