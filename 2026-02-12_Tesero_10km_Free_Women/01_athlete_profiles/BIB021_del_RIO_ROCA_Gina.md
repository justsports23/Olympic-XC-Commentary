## The Person Behind the Skis

### From Tiny Andorra, Population 88,000
Gina del Rio Roca represents **Andorra** — a microstate of ~88,000 people nestled between France and Spain in the Pyrenees. Cross-country skiing is not a traditional sport there; alpine skiing dominates. Only **two Andorran athletes** compete at the highest international XC level: Gina and **Irineu Esteve Altimiras**.

*"It's a small country and cross-country skiing is not super traditional there. Getting good results, being from Andorra, is not easy. We don't have as many resources as Norway, Sweden or the other big countries."* — [Salomon](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/athlete/gina-del-rio-roca)

### Training with the French
Without a national XC infrastructure, del Rio trains regularly with **Les Bleuettes** — the French women's development team. She benefits from Andorra's **natural altitude** for training while accessing French coaching and competition networks.

### Tour de Ski Childhood Memories
*"I remember watching it during the holidays with my family when I was younger. I really like the Tour de Ski, especially the Final Climb."* — This January, she raced her first TdS at the venue she watched as a child.

### World Junior Champion
Despite coming from a tiny nation, del Rio won the **World Junior Championship** in sprint skate at Planica (2023-24 season) — proving that talent transcends national resources.

### 10th at the World Championships
Her **10th-place finish at the 2025 World Championship sprint** in Trondheim was the second-best result in Andorran sporting history. She was overcome with emotion: *"It feels amazing to represent Andorra because it's a small country."*

### Other Sports
She also competes in **mountain biking and road cycling** — the endurance foundation for a multi-sport athlete.

## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Origins
Gina del Rio Roca was born on January 26, 2004, in **Sant Julia de Loria**, a parish in the far south of Andorra and the lowest settlement in the principality at 908 meters elevation ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=239521)). She grew up in the Pyrenees in a country of just 88,000 people where alpine skiing dominates and cross-country skiing has virtually no tradition ([Salomon](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/athlete/gina-del-rio-roca)).

### How She Started Skiing
Del Rio Roca was sponsored by **Salomon from age 11**, an early bet on a young talent from a tiny nation ([Salomon](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/athlete/gina-del-rio-roca)). Growing up and training at altitude in Andorra became a natural advantage, providing sustained aerobic development on courses that reward climbing efficiency ([FIS News](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/u23-leader-del-rio-targets-tour-de-ski-challenge)). Without a national XC infrastructure, she trains regularly with **Les Bleuettes**, the French women's development team, accessing coaching and competition networks that Andorra cannot provide on its own ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-the-goals-of-andorrans-gina-del-rio-and-irineu-esteve-altimiras-1109/)).

### Family & Childhood Memories
Del Rio Roca grew up watching the Tour de Ski during the holidays with her family: *"I remember watching it during the holidays with my family when I was younger. I really like the Tour de Ski, especially the Final Climb."* In January 2026, she raced her first Tour de Ski at the venue she watched as a child ([FIS News](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/u23-leader-del-rio-targets-tour-de-ski-challenge)).

### Multi-Sport Athlete
Outside of cross-country skiing, del Rio Roca competes in **mountain biking and road cycling**. She has competed in Spanish national road racing championships and participates in road races as a registered cyclist ([FirstCycling](https://firstcycling.com/rider.php?r=243097)). The endurance foundation from cycling complements her skiing.

### Personality & Pride in Andorra
Del Rio Roca speaks with genuine pride about representing her small nation: *"It feels amazing to represent Andorra because it's a small country and cross-country skiing is not super traditional there. It is more Alpine skiing, even though there is a lot of cross-country skiing in my region too."* She also acknowledges the challenges: *"Getting good results, being from Andorra, is not easy. We don't have as many resources as Norway, Sweden or the other big countries."* ([Salomon](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/athlete/gina-del-rio-roca)) She views her international success as inspiration for athletes from small nations ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-trondheim-tenth-in-the-sprint-skate-andorran-gina-del-rio-recounts-her-incredible-day-0227/)).

### Social Media & Sponsorships
On Instagram ([@ginadroca](https://www.instagram.com/ginadroca/)), she lists sponsors including Salomon Nordic, KV+ Australia, CR&Nsupporting, and Naturland Andorra.
