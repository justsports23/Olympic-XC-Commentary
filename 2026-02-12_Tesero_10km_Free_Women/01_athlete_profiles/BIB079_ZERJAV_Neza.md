Zerjav is a two-time Olympian at age 26, making her the most Games-experienced athlete among these late starters. Her versatility as a multi-sport endurance athlete -- competing in trail running, road running (half marathon, 10K), and cross-country skiing -- speaks to a deep aerobic engine. She carries the highest FIS distance points (148.57) of the athletes in this bib range, making her the lowest-seeded starter in the race. Slovenia has a small but dedicated cross-country skiing program, and Zerjav is one of their flag bearers in the discipline.
