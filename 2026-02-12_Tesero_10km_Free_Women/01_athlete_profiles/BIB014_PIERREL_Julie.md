| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Time Back |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|

Note: Tesero/Val di Fiemme is a venue Pierrel has raced at during the Tour de Ski and earlier Olympic events this week. She described the classic sprint track as one that ["had already smiled on them during the Tour de Ski"](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-melissa-gal-and-julie-pierrel-pass-the-classic-sprint-qualifier-with-flying-colours-with-the-swedes-in-front-0210/).

## Key Storylines
- **Olympic debut and breakthrough season:** Pierrel is experiencing her first Olympic Games and described it as ["truly incredible"](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/olympic-games-2026-cross-country-skiing-it-was-great-i-enjoyed-myself-a-positive-first-olympic-games-for-julie-pierrel-and-cloe-pagnier-0207/). She and teammate Cloé Pagnier both achieved top-30 skiathlon finishes in their first Olympic race.
- **Rapid progression:** After discovering the World Cup in [January 2024 at Oberhof](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-after-her-breakthrough-last-winter-julie-pierrel-returns-to-the-world-cup-in-davos-i-know-what-to-expect-she-tells-nordic-magazine-1211/), Pierrel has rapidly improved from FESA Cup races to consistent World Cup finishes in just two seasons.
- **Sprint ambitions realized then dashed (Feb 10):** Pierrel had high expectations for the Olympic sprint, noting it was ["where I had my best World Cup finish a month ago (sixteenth)"](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/olympic-games-2026-cross-country-skiing-it-was-great-i-enjoyed-myself-a-positive-first-olympic-games-for-julie-pierrel-and-cloe-pagnier-0207/). She qualified 18th and advanced to the QFs but was eliminated there. Now racing the 10km free just 2 days later — fatigue from the sprint effort could be a factor.
- **French team depth:** Pierrel is part of a deep French women's squad featuring Delphine Claudel, Léonie Perry, Mélissa Gal, and Cloé Pagnier, reflecting France's growing strength in women's cross-country.
- **Local roots:** From [Le Grand Bornand](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-les-rousses-bornandine-julie-pierrel-progresses-in-the-world-cup-0119/) in Haute-Savoie, she skis for Ski Club Grand Bornand.
