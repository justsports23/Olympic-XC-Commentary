## Personal Life & Background
- **Hometown:** Gyumri, Shirak Province, Armenia — Armenia's second-largest city, which was devastated by the 1988 Spitak earthquake and spent decades rebuilding ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katya_Galstyan))
- **Family:** Grew up in a close-knit Armenian family. Her mother, Karine Gevorgyan, has described the hardships of the post-earthquake and wartime period — basic necessities like heating were scarce, and even reaching the maternity hospital during Katya's birth was challenging due to shortages and poor conditions ([Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com/page/katya_galstyan))
- **Early life:** As a young child, Galstyan loved playing in the snow and seemed impervious to the cold — an early indicator of her comfort in wintry environments. Living conditions in Gyumri remained modest, with the family adapting to limited amenities in the earthquake's aftermath, instilling a sense of perseverance ([Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com/page/katya_galstyan))
- **How she started skiing:** At age 16, she had a serendipitous encounter with Slavik Sargsyan, the head coach of the Armenian national ski team, who encouraged her to begin training. She joined the Ashotsk Ski Club in nearby Ashotsk, Shirak Province, and developed under Sargsyan's guidance. She later reflected that she never imagined skiing would define her life, yet it evolved into a deep dedication driven by the joy of the sport and a sense of national representation ([Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com/page/katya_galstyan))
- **Physical stats:** 163 cm tall, 57 kg ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katya_Galstyan))
