---

## Event Context: 10km Interval Start Freestyle

This is a **distance freestyle** race — and distance is exactly where Janatova thrives. In the sprint classic on Feb 10, she was a distance skier somewhat out of her element (FIS Sprint Points 51.24; qualified 33rd at Ruka, 42nd at Trondheim). But in the 10km freestyle interval start, she is in her natural habitat. Her seeded BIB 36 reflects her standing as a legitimate distance competitor.

Janatova has spent several years training not only in the Czech Republic but especially in Norway during the off-season.

## The Person Behind the Skis

### The Distance Skier Who Shone in the Skiathlon
Janatova is primarily a distance skier who produced a stunning **7th place in the Olympic skiathlon on February 7** -- one of the best results of her career, confirming she arrived at these Games in peak form. That 7th place was a major result for Czech cross-country skiing and validates her selection for the 10km free.

## Olympic Skiathlon Result (Feb 7, 2026)

Janatova placed **7th in the Olympic skiathlon** on February 7 — an outstanding result and arguably the performance of her career. The skiathlon combines classic and freestyle over 7.5km each, and her strong finish demonstrated excellent freestyle capability in the second half. This directly translates to confidence and form heading into the 10km free.

## Season Form (2025-26)
| Date | Event | Location | Discipline | Format | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Nov 2025 | World Cup | Ruka, FIN | Sprint Classic | Qualification | 33rd | Sprint not her strength |
| Dec 2025 | World Cup | Trondheim, NOR | Sprint Classic | Qualification | 42nd | Sprint qualifier only |
| Feb 7, 2026 | Olympics | Tesero, ITA | Skiathlon 7.5+7.5 | Individual | **7th** | Career-best Olympic result; peak form |

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Freestyle strength:** Strong — the freestyle leg of the skiathlon was where she finished strongly to secure 7th
- **Classic strength:** Capable — competed in classic sprints but results suggest freestyle is her stronger technique
- **Distance preference:** **True distance specialist** — the 10km IS Free is her optimal format
- **Sprint ability:** Limited at elite level (33rd, 42nd in sprint qualifications this season)
- **Climbing ability:** [DATA NOT FOUND] — but her skiathlon 7th on this course (which includes the Tesero climbs) speaks for itself
- **10km Free assessment:** With 7th in the skiathlon just five days ago, Janatova is in the form of her life. She knows the course intimately from the skiathlon. A top-10 finish is a realistic target, and another top-7 would not be a surprise.

## Key Storylines
1. **Skiathlon 7th — the form of her life:** Five days ago she produced arguably her best-ever Olympic result
2. **Distance skier in a distance race:** Unlike the sprint, this is her terrain
3. **Czech dark horse:** Not a household name, but her skiathlon performance demands respect
4. **Course familiarity:** She raced on this exact course five days ago in the skiathlon — she knows every climb and descent
5. **Seeded start (BIB 36):** Her seeded position means she starts later with split-time information available

## Commentary Gold
- **7th in the Olympic skiathlon just five days ago** — she arrives in the form of her life
- A **distance specialist finally in a distance race** — the sprint was an appetizer, this is the main course
- Czech cross-country skiing doesn't produce many top-10 Olympic finishers — she could do it twice in one Games
- The **freestyle half of the skiathlon** was where she was strongest — a direct preview for the 10km free
- BIB 36 gives her **late-race intelligence** on how the competition is unfolding
- If she finishes top-7 again, it would confirm this as a **breakout Olympic Games** for Janatova
