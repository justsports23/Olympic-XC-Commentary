- **Family team:**
  - **Father Boonchan Chanloung:** A sports enthusiast who once cycled 15,000 kilometers around Thailand in 126 days. Serves as team manager and technical lead for the Thai ski team. His philosophy: sport was initially just a means to keep his children healthy and as a backup plan, not a grand aspiration — but it became their life's work. *"I'm very proud to be part of the Thai team. It not only makes our family more harmonious but also brings together Thai people around the world to cheer for our team"* ([Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/3185390/thailands-skiing-siblings-return-home-for-winter-games); [Nation Thailand](https://www.nationthailand.com/blogs/news/sport/40061835))

- **How she started skiing:** Started skiing at age 3 with her father's encouragement.

## Venue History
No prior results at Tesero. However, Chanloung grew up in Gressoney-La-Trinite in Italy's Aosta Valley — she is essentially racing on home soil in Italy.

## Key Storylines
Chanloung's story is unique in Olympic sport: born to an Italian mother and Thai father, raised in the Italian Alps (Gressoney-La-Trinite, Aosta Valley), she originally competed for Italy before switching to represent Thailand in 2016 under FIS nationality rules. She and her brother Mark form a skiing sibling duo that has put tropical Thailand on the cross-country skiing map. This is her third Olympic Games — she carried the Thai flag at Beijing 2022. She has said "This Olympics will be more special because it's in Italy, where we grew up." Beyond competition, she has helped establish a foundation to support Thai youth in winter sports and contributed to the expansion of roller-skiing programmes in Thailand. In 2024, Thailand claimed its first Winter Youth Olympic medal (silver in monobob at Gangwon), building on the momentum she and Mark helped create.
