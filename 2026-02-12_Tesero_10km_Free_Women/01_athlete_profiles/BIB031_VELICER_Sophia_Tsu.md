## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Upbringing
Sophia Tsu Velicer was born on March 9, 1999, in Michigan, USA, and grew up in Traverse City, Michigan -- a region known for its outdoor recreation and winter sports culture. She was raised by a Taiwanese mother and an American father, growing up as a dual national with deep ties to both countries. Her Chinese name is Yu Rui (余睿). ([Formosa News](https://english.ftvnews.com.tw/news/2026209W06EA))

### Family
Velicer's family has been central to her skiing journey. Her extended family traveled to Italy to cheer for her at the 2026 Olympics, including her 86-year-old maternal grandmother, who Sophia has described as one of her biggest supporters throughout the years. The Olympic appearance marked her grandmother's first time seeing Sophia compete in cross-country skiing at the Games. ([Formosa News](https://english.ftvnews.com.tw/news/2026209W06EA))

### How She Started Skiing
Sophia began cross-country skiing as a child in Traverse City, Michigan. At just 11 years old in 2011, she entered the 12km Classic North American Vasa race, finishing 4th in 1:40:21. That early exposure to competitive Nordic skiing in Michigan's vibrant cross-country community planted the seeds for her eventual international career.

### Education
Velicer attended the University of Vermont, where the skiing program (the VCats) helped develop her competitive abilities while she pursued her education. [DATA NOT FOUND -- specific degree and graduation details]

### Taiwanese-American Identity & Representation
Though she has never fully lived in Taiwan, Velicer has expressed a close connection to her mother's homeland. She chose to represent Chinese Taipei on the world stage, becoming the first-ever Olympic cross-country skier for Chinese Taipei -- a historic milestone for Taiwan's winter sports program. Because of the lack of winter sports resources in Taiwan, Taiwanese athletes have long relied on training and competing abroad to prepare for the Games.

### Notable Stories
Velicer's Olympic debut carries particular significance: Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) has appeared at Winter Olympics since the 1984 Sarajevo Games in other sports, but had never before sent a cross-country skier to the Games. Sophia's qualification through the basic quota made her a pioneer and a source of national pride, with Taiwanese officials emphasizing that "it is no small feat for Taiwan to have six women and four men qualify" for the 2026 Winter Games.
