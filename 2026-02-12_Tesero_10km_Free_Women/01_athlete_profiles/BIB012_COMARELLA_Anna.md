## Key Storylines
- **Third-time Olympian on home soil:** Comarella is a three-time Olympian (PyeongChang 2018, Beijing 2022, and now Milano Cortina 2026). She has described the home Olympics as her "last dance" — a career-crowning moment in her home region. — [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/22360)
- **Local knowledge advantage:** Based in Moena, Trentino, Comarella races regularly in the Val di Fiemme area. Few athletes on the start list will have as much course familiarity as she does. — [Fondazione Cortina](https://fondazionecortina.com/en/team/anna-comarella/)
- **Scholar-athlete:** Earned a degree in International Trade from Ca' Foscari University of Venice in 2021, and has been enrolled in Law at the University of Bologna since 2023 — one of the most academically accomplished athletes in the field. — [Fondazione Cortina](https://fondazionecortina.com/en/team/anna-comarella/)
- **Veteran experience:** At 28, Comarella is the most experienced athlete in this bib range, with two prior Olympic Games, multiple World Championships, and years of Tour de Ski experience. Her consistent 30th-40th range finishes this season show reliable but not elite-level competitiveness.
- **Strong Italian domestic form:** Italian Cup victories suggest she performs well in domestic racing conditions, which could translate well to this home Olympic venue.
- **Upward form curve:** Improved from 53rd (Ruka) to 37th (Milano Cortina) over the course of the 2025-26 season, suggesting she may be timing her peak for the Olympics.
