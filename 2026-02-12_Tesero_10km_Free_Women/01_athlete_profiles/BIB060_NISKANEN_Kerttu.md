### Husband & Coach: Juho Mikkonen
- Kerttu met fellow skier Juho Mikkonen on a shared skiing camp in Vuokatti when she was 17 and he was 15. They have been together for over 17 years -- more than half of their lives. They got engaged in 2010 and married on 8 August 2020, arriving at the wedding in Vierema by helicopter [Anna.fi — Kerttu Niskanen ja Juho Mikkonen](https://anna.fi/ihmiset/kerttu-niskanen-ja-juho-puoliso-ovat-olleet-yhdessa-teini-ikaisista-vaikka-oltiin-ihan-lapsia-juhosta-tuli-luotettava-vaikutelma) [MTV Uutiset — Niskanen and Mikkonen 17 years together](https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/huippuhiihtaja-kerttu-niskanen-ja-juho-mikkonen-ovat-seurustelleet-jo-17-vuotta-kuinka-se-voi-olla-mahdollista-kun-naytatte-22-vuotiailta/8417256)
- Juho has served as Kerttu's personal coach since 2019.

Kerttu has said of their relationship: "Ei me olla osattu riidella" ("We've never really known how to argue") [Kotiliesi — Kerttu Niskanen](https://kotiliesi.fi/ihmiset/kerttu-niskanen-annassa/)

### How She Started Skiing
- Kerttu knew early on that she was going to be a professional skier. Growing up in Vierema with a ski trail practically at her doorstep, skiing was a natural part of childhood. Her passion for the sport has driven her entire career: "My passion for skiing has always been so strong that I've never had to go looking for motivation" [Halti — Kerttu Niskanen: No Plan B](https://halti.com/blogs/stories/kerttu-niskanen-no-plan-b)

### Overcoming Adversity
- At the beginning of 2021, just before the World Championships, Kerttu fractured her fibula, and her chase for medals turned into uncertainty about the rest of her career. After a long rehab and persistent training, she returned the following winter and topped it off with two Olympic medals at Beijing 2022 -- a silver in the 10km classic (losing gold to Therese Johaug by just 0.4 seconds) and a bronze in the 30km [Halti — Kerttu Niskanen: No Plan B](https://halti.com/blogs/stories/kerttu-niskanen-no-plan-b)

- **Dog Martta:** When the season ends, Kerttu enjoys recreational skiing with her husband Juho and their dog Martta, who rides in a backpack or trailer. "Martta loves the speed and the wind just as much as I do. I think we both love skiing" [Halti — Kerttu Niskanen: No Plan B](https://halti.com/blogs/stories/kerttu-niskanen-no-plan-b)
- **Off-Season Skiing:** While many athletes head south for sun after the season, Kerttu gets back on the snow recreationally: "It's a totally different kind of skiing: no heart-rate monitor needed. When there's a nice cafe on the trail, we stop for a cinnamon roll" [Halti — Kerttu Niskanen: No Plan B](https://halti.com/blogs/stories/kerttu-niskanen-no-plan-b)
- **Known for Honesty:** Kerttu is known for her candid post-race assessments: "I say things as they are. If I'm not in shape or the skis don't work, I'll say it. My team and I have realized that honest feedback is the best way to improve" [Halti — Kerttu Niskanen: No Plan B](https://halti.com/blogs/stories/kerttu-niskanen-no-plan-b)

### Other Notable Results

- First podiums in freestyle races came in 2025 at age 36 -- a testament to her continued development

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Freestyle strength:** Historically her weaker technique, but has improved dramatically in recent seasons; first freestyle podiums in 2025 at age 36. Her 5th place in the Olympic skiathlon and competitive 2025-26 free results show genuine freestyle ability.
- **Classic strength:** World-class -- all 8 World Cup wins have come in classic technique. She is one of the premier classic skiers in the world and has been for over a decade.
- **Distance preference:** Distance specialist (10km, 20km, 30km). Not a sprint contender (typically finishes 30th-40th in sprint qualifications).
- **Climbing ability:** Excellent -- her bronze medal in the Beijing 30km came on a demanding course where she held off Diggins on the final climb. At Goms in January 2026, she was just 7.4 seconds off the win in a 20km classic mass start.
- **Best format:** Classic interval start is her strongest format; her Olympic silver in Beijing came in this format. Also very strong in classic mass starts and pursuits.

## Key Storylines

### Late-Career Renaissance and Final Olympics
At 37, Niskanen is likely competing in her fourth and final Olympic Games. Her career has seen a remarkable late-career resurgence -- she won her first individual Olympic medals at age 33 in Beijing, and has continued to perform at an elite level. She picked up 11 podiums in two seasons and won the Distance Cup in 2022-23. This may be her last chance for an Olympic individual medal.

### The Niskanen Family Legacy
Her younger brother Iivo Niskanen is a three-time Olympic champion. On 29 December 2021, the siblings made history by winning World Cup 10km and 15km events in Lenzerheide on the same day. Between them, the Niskanen siblings have won nine Olympic medals and five World Championship medals -- one of the most decorated sibling pairs in cross-country skiing history.

### Classic Specialist in a Freestyle Race
This 10km free interval start race is not Niskanen's strongest format -- her dominance has been in classic technique. However, her late-career improvement in freestyle has been notable, with her first freestyle podiums coming in 2025. Her 5th place in the Olympic skiathlon (which includes a freestyle half) and her competitive 2025-26 freestyle results suggest she can contend for a top-10 finish here.

### Course Familiarity
Niskanen has raced at the Tesero/Val di Fiemme venues multiple times during Tour de Ski stages, including a 4th-place finish in the 10km classic at Toblach in December 2025. She also placed 5th in the Olympic skiathlon on this course five days earlier.

### Season Trajectory
After a slow start at Ruka (19th-20th), Niskanen found form during the Tour de Ski (4th and 7th) and was in 3rd place overall in the Tour before a DNS at Val di Fiemme. Her 4th at Goms confirmed the upward trajectory heading into the Olympics.
