# Jessie DIGGINS (USA)
**Pronunciation:** *JES-ee DIG-inz*
**Bib:** 44 | **Start Time:** 13:22:00 | **FIS Code:** 146768 | **DOB:** August 26, 1991 (age 34) | **Born:** Saint Paul, Minnesota; raised in Afton, Minnesota — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Diggins)
**Club:** Stifel U.S. Cross Country Ski Team (A Team) | **National Team:** USA Nordic A-Team
**Equipment:** Salomon skis (S/LAB Carbon), Salomon boots, Swix poles

**Event:** Women's 10km Interval Start Free | **Leader of the Overall World Cup**

---

## Event Context: 10km Interval Start Freestyle

This is a **distance freestyle** race — a format that plays directly to Diggins' greatest strengths. Unlike the sprint classic on Feb 10, this 10km individual time trial in skating technique is the kind of race where Diggins has built her legend. She is the reigning Overall World Cup leader, a 3x Tour de Ski champion, and one of the finest distance freestyle skiers in history. The interval start format rewards pure fitness and pacing — no pack tactics, no crashes to get caught behind. Diggins' late-race BIB 44 means she will have split-time information on every other competitor before she starts.

## The Person Behind the Skis

### "The Glitter Fairy" — America's Most Joyful Athlete
Diggins is known as **"the Glitter Fairy"** by her teammates. Before every race, she decorates her cheeks with **biodegradable glitter** and face paint — a tradition dating back to **Stillwater High School** in Minnesota.

*"Putting glitter on before a race is this reminder to myself that I get to do this, that I have to remember to have fun."* She describes herself as *"the sparkly chipmunk that I am."*

### Family — Skiing in the Blood
- **Parents:** Clay and Deb Diggins met at **Gustavus Adolphus College** in Minnesota
- **Husband:** Wade Poplawski — a former **Canadian ice hockey player**, now a financial analyst in Boston. They met at a friend's wedding in 2015 and married in May 2022
- The family joined the **Minnesota Youth Ski League** when Jessie was young, spending every Sunday afternoon all winter playing games on skis
- Her first memory of skiing: *"Yelling 'mush' at my dad from his backpack"* and pulling his hair yelling **"FASTER"** — [JessieDiggins.com](https://jessiediggins.com/about-2/)

### The Eating Disorder — "It Saved My Life"
At **age 18**, Diggins struggled with **bulimia**. Her parents found The Emily Program, a treatment center, and the intervention *"saved her life."* She wrote the autobiography **"Brave Enough"** (2020) documenting her struggle and recovery, hoping to help others facing similar challenges.

She is now an **ambassador for The Emily Program**, describing this advocacy work as *"the most impactful and rewarding experience of my entire career"* — more meaningful than any gold medal. — [JessieDiggins.com](https://jessiediggins.com/eating-disorders-awareness-week-and-a-brave-enough-book-excerpt/)

### Renaissance Woman
- Took **dance classes for 10 years**: *"I was never that good, but I LOVED it. Blame that for my love of glitter and pink."*
- Choreographed the viral **"Uptown Funk" music video** with the U.S. Ski Team
- Chases adrenaline: **cliff jumping, bungee jumping, skydiving**
- **Climate change advocate** — uses her platform to speak about environmental protection
- Post-retirement goal: run a **100-mile trail ultramarathon**
- First American to receive the **Holmenkollen Medal** (2024) — Norway's highest skiing honor

### The Farewell Tour
This is Diggins' **fourth and final Olympic Games**. She announced her retirement in November 2025, with her final race at the **Lake Placid World Cup Finals** in March 2026. She's pursuing her **4th consecutive Overall Crystal Globe** — unprecedented in women's XC history.

An individual Olympic gold is the one achievement that would cap the most legendary career in American cross-country skiing history. Her desire to potentially start a family with husband Wade was part of the retirement decision.

## The Most Decorated American XC Skier in History

### Olympic Medal Collection
| Games | Event | Medal | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| PyeongChang 2018 | Team Sprint | **GOLD** | With Kikkan Randall — USA's first-ever XC Olympic gold |
| Beijing 2022 | 30km Freestyle | **Silver** | |
| Beijing 2022 | Sprint Freestyle | **Bronze** | Olympic sprint medalist |

### The Defining Moment: PyeongChang 2018
On February 21, 2018, Diggins and childhood idol **Kikkan Randall** won the team sprint — America's **first-ever Olympic gold medal** in cross-country skiing. The final 100 meters, with Diggins charging past the Swedes, remains one of the most replayed moments in American Winter Olympic history.

### Val di Fiemme Connection
Diggins won her **2013 World Championship Team Sprint gold** at this very venue in Val di Fiemme — with Kikkan Randall. She's racing in a place that holds some of her most precious memories.

## Olympic Skiathlon Result (Feb 7, 2026)

Diggins placed **8th in the Olympic skiathlon** on February 7, finishing **+2:21.1** behind the winner. She was caught behind a crash caused by Nissinen and fell, losing significant time. She was uninjured but the incident cost her any chance at a medal. The 8th-place finish, while disappointing relative to her overall form, showed her ability to recover and fight through adversity — qualities that will serve her well in the 10km freestyle, where there are no pack dynamics or crash risks.

- **Sprint World Cup:** 6th (387 pts)

## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Upbringing
Jessica "Jessie" Diggins was born on August 26, 1991, in **Saint Paul, Minnesota**, and raised in **Afton, Minnesota** -- a very small rural town only three miles from Afton State Park ([Wikipedia - Jessie Diggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Diggins)). Growing up in Afton gave her perfect training conditions -- she could roller ski right from her front door ([Yahoo Finance - Afton native](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/afton-native-jessie-diggins-isnt-190200414.html)). The town of Afton now has a street sign called **"Jessie Diggins Trail"** in her honor ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/afton-native-jessie-diggins-isnt-190200414.html)). She graduated from **Stillwater Area High School** in 2010, where she first developed her signature glitter tradition. She has said: *"My high school ski team at Stillwater High was fueled by so many kind volunteers and a very supportive community."* ([JessieDiggins.com - About](https://jessiediggins.com/about-2/))

### Family
- **Parents -- Clay and Deb Diggins:** Both born in Canada. Her mother Deb grew up near Pike Lake in Duluth and attended Proctor High School. Her father Clay was born in **Thunder Bay, Ontario**, and has a green card, making Jessie a **dual citizen of Canada and the United States** ([Sportskeeda - Jessie Diggins Family](https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/olympics/jessie-diggins-family)). She has said: *"So many of my family lives up there, and both my parents were born there. I feel so proud to have half of my heart there."* ([Akron News Reporter](https://www.akronnewsreporter.com/2026/01/28/cross-country-diggins/)). Clay and Deb met at **Gustavus Adolphus College** in Minnesota and married on August 25, 1983 ([Sportskeeda - Jessie Diggins Family](https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/olympics/jessie-diggins-family)). The family owns and runs a **Slumberland Furniture store** in Red Wing, Minnesota, which they purchased from friends in 2009 ([Sportskeeda - Jessie Diggins Family](https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/olympics/jessie-diggins-family))
- **Sister -- Mackenzie Diggins:** Five years younger than Jessie. Mackenzie attended the Saint Paul Conservatory for Performing Artists and earned her degree in Musical Theatre Performance from the University of Minnesota Duluth. She is now a film director, model, singer, and stand-up comedian ([ProfileLayers - Jessie Diggins](https://profilelayers.com/jessie-diggins/))
- **Husband -- Wade Poplawski:** A Canadian from Winnipeg, Manitoba, who attended **Colgate University** on a hockey scholarship and also played for the Rapid City Rush. They met at a fellow Olympian's wedding in Canada, where he noticed her at the giant Jenga game. After "losing" a game, Wade drove from Boston to Jessie's door in Vermont ([Minnesota Bride - Wedding](https://mnbride.com/olympic-gold-medalist-jessie-diggins-garden-chic-wedding-almquist-farm)). Wade proposed at **Monadnock State Park** in New Hampshire in April 2020 ([ProfileLayers - Jessie Diggins](https://profilelayers.com/jessie-diggins/)). They married on **June 3, 2022, at Almquist Farm** in Hastings, Minnesota, in a garden-chic ceremony beneath a grand oak tree ([Minnesota Bride - Wedding](https://mnbride.com/olympic-gold-medalist-jessie-diggins-garden-chic-wedding-almquist-farm)). Wade now works as a Securitized Product Sales specialist at Citi in Boston ([Sportskeeda - Jessie Diggins Husband](https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/olympics/jessie-diggins-husband)). Her father Clay has spoken about the relationship: *"She's really comfortable with her life right now. She's found a great soulmate in Wade. She's settled in with things. That allows her to take a little bit longer view of things now than she did before."* ([Sportskeeda - Jessie Diggins Family](https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/olympics/jessie-diggins-family)). The couple lives between **Stratton, Vermont** (where Jessie trains) and **South Boston** (where Wade works) ([Sportskeeda - Jessie Diggins Husband](https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/olympics/jessie-diggins-husband))

### How She Started Skiing
Diggins began skiing at **age four** when her family joined the **Minnesota Youth Ski League**, spending every Sunday afternoon all winter playing games on skis ([JessieDiggins.com - About](https://jessiediggins.com/about-2/)). Her first memory of skiing: *"Yelling 'mush' at my dad from his backpack"* and pulling his hair yelling **"FASTER"** ([JessieDiggins.com - About](https://jessiediggins.com/about-2/)). She showed prowess for skiing at age 11 when she started competing against older children ([Team USA - Jessie Diggins](https://www.teamusa.com/profiles/jessie-diggins-881331)).

### Education
Diggins graduated from Stillwater Area High School in 2010. She earned an academic scholarship to **Northern Michigan University** but deferred enrollment to race with the Central Cross-Country Elite team for one year. Finding that being a professional athlete was her dream job, she decided to go all-in and never enrolled ([JessieDiggins.com - About](https://jessiediggins.com/about-2/)) ([Wikipedia - Jessie Diggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Diggins)).

### The Eating Disorder -- "Brave Enough"
At **age 18**, during her senior year at Stillwater, Diggins struggled with **bulimia**. She has written: *"I wanted to be really, really good at skiing, and I believed that to do that, I needed to have a super-lean body."* ([Team USA - Brave Enough](https://www.teamusa.org/News/2020/March/27/Brave-Enough-Jessie-Diggins-Opens-Up-About-Bulimia-And-Olympic-Triumph-In-Her-New-Book)). With the support of her parents, she sought treatment at **The Emily Program**, a national leader in eating disorder treatment. She has said: *"not because I'm an ambassador for them, but because their treatment program literally saved my life."* ([JessieDiggins.com - ED Awareness](https://jessiediggins.com/eating-disorders-awareness-week-and-a-brave-enough-book-excerpt/))

In 2020, she published her autobiography **"Brave Enough"** documenting her struggle and recovery. Writing the eating disorder chapters was the most difficult but also the most healing part: *"It's amazing how many details I had blacked out from that time just because it was traumatic for me."* ([Team USA - Brave Enough](https://www.teamusa.org/News/2020/March/27/Brave-Enough-Jessie-Diggins-Opens-Up-About-Bulimia-And-Olympic-Triumph-In-Her-New-Book))

In the **summer of 2023**, Diggins experienced a **relapse**, driven by the pressure of pursuing perfection: *"I started getting back to this idea that I have to be perfect, and some pretty binary thinking like it has to be perfect if I were going to do it."* She set no results goals for the 2023-24 season to prioritize her mental health ([Team USA - Prioritizing Mental Health](https://www.teamusa.com/news/2023/november/23/jessie-diggins-is-prioritizing-her-mental-health-this-season)). She is now an **ambassador for The Emily Program** and has described this advocacy work as *"the most impactful and rewarding experience of my entire career"* -- more meaningful than any gold medal ([JessieDiggins.com - ED Awareness](https://jessiediggins.com/eating-disorders-awareness-week-and-a-brave-enough-book-excerpt/)).

### Climate Advocacy
Diggins is an ambassador for **Protect Our Winters (POW)**, a non-profit climate advocacy organization. She traveled to Capitol Hill in April 2018 with POW to raise concerns about climate change ([Protect Our Winters - Jessie Diggins](https://protectourwinters.org/with-a-medal-in-my-pocket/)). She has been outspoken about what she has witnessed firsthand: *"Most of my races are now on manmade snow. We're racing in these mountain towns, on a strip of dirty, icy, dangerously fast manmade snow with mud and green grass on either side, in January, in the mountains of Europe. That is a warning sign."* ([NBC Olympics - Climate Advocacy](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/olympian-jessie-diggins-using-her-voice-climate-advocacy-who-am-i-not-care)). She also advocates: *"Who am I to not care? I could just bury my head in the sand and watch the world burn, or I could do what I can, where I can, when I can."* ([NBC Olympics - Climate Advocacy](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/olympian-jessie-diggins-using-her-voice-climate-advocacy-who-am-i-not-care))

At the 2025 World Championships, Diggins and the US Ski Team partnered with POW to wear special race suits depicting a **melting glacier** to bring awareness to climate change ([Olympics.com - Earth Day 2025](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/earth-day-2025-jessie-diggins-olympians-speaking-climate-issues-only-planet)).

### Personal Interests & Hobbies
- Took **dance classes for 10 years**: *"I was never that good, but I LOVED it. Blame that for my love of glitter and pink."* ([JessieDiggins.com - About](https://jessiediggins.com/about-2/))
- Choreographed the viral **"Uptown Funk" music video** with the U.S. Ski Team ([Olympics.com - 5 Things to Know](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/race-sparkles-advocacy-5-things-to-know-usa-skier-jessie-diggins))
- Adrenaline junkie: **cliff jumping, bungee jumping, skydiving** ([JessieDiggins.com - About](https://jessiediggins.com/about-2/))
- Post-retirement goal: run a **100-mile trail ultramarathon** ([JessieDiggins.com - About](https://jessiediggins.com/about-2/))
- **First American** to receive the **Holmenkollen Medal** (2024) -- Norway's highest skiing honor, awarded by Crown Prince Haakon ([SnowBrains - Holmenkollen Medal](https://snowbrains.com/royal-treatment-jessie-diggins-becomes-first-american-to-be-awarded-the-norwegian-holmenkollen-medal/))

### "The Glitter Fairy"
Known as **"the Glitter Fairy"** by teammates, Diggins decorates her cheeks with **biodegradable glitter** and face paint before every race -- a tradition dating back to Stillwater High School. *"Putting glitter on before a race is this reminder to myself that I get to do this, that I have to remember to have fun."* ([JessieDiggins.com - About](https://jessiediggins.com/about-2/)). When Minnesota state high school rules banned glitter in races, dozens of students signed a petition -- Diggins and several U.S. Ski Team members also signed -- and the officials relented ([MPR News - Glitter and Gold](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/11/04/jessie-diggins-duluth-olympic-gold-nordic-skiing)).

### The Farewell Tour
This is Diggins' **fourth and final Olympic Games**. She announced her retirement in November 2025, with her final race set for the **Lake Placid World Cup Finals** in March 2026. Her desire to potentially start a family with Wade was part of the retirement decision ([NBC Olympics - Retirement](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/jessie-diggins-announces-retirement-2026-olympics-will-be-last-cross-country-skier)) ([US Ski & Snowboard - Retirement](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/one-final-season-jessie-diggins-announces-retirement-following-end-2025-26-season)).

## Career Highlights
- **Olympic medals:** Gold (Team Sprint 2018), Silver (30km 2022), Bronze (Sprint 2022)
- **Overall Crystal Globe:** 3x champion (2021, 2024, 2026 — pursuing 4th consecutive)
- **Tour de Ski:** 3x champion (2021, 2024, 2026 — first American to win)
- **Distance Crystal Globe:** 3x champion
- **World Cup victories:** 33 | **World Cup podiums:** 88
- **Holmenkollen Medal:** 2024 (first American recipient)
- **World Championship medals:** 7

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Strong and improving — *"working with teammates to strengthen classic style"* specifically for the sprint classic (NBC)
- **Freestyle strength:** **Elite — this is her primary technique.** The majority of her career success, including the Beijing 30km silver, has been in freestyle. The 10km free is a natural fit for her skillset.
- **Sprint ability:** Olympic sprint medalist (Beijing bronze), but primarily a distance skier
- **Distance preference:** **True distance specialist** — the 10km IS Free is her optimal race format. She thrives in individual time trials where pure fitness and pacing decide the outcome.
- **Climbing ability:** Excellent — 3x Tour de Ski champion (Alpe Cermis climber). The Tesero course's climbing demands play to her strengths.
- **Interval start assessment:** Diggins excels at self-paced efforts. With BIB 44, she'll have complete split-time data from the entire field before she starts — a significant tactical advantage for the World Cup leader.

## Venue History
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-------|
| 2013 | World Champs | Team Sprint | **GOLD** | With Randall — at this venue |

| Feb 7, 2026 | Olympics | Skiathlon | 8th | Fell after Nissinen crash; +2:21.1 |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Olympics | Sprint Classic | 17th (QF elim.) | Qual 20th; bruised ribs from skiathlon fall |

## Key Storylines
1. **The Farewell Tour:** Final Olympics — an individual gold is the missing piece
2. **Skiathlon adversity:** 8th after falling behind Nissinen's crash — she'll be hungry for redemption in the 10km
3. **Sprint classic with bruised ribs (Feb 10):** Competed in the sprint classic just 2 days before this 10km, finishing 17th overall (qualified 20th, eliminated 4th in QF4). Raced with bruised ribs sustained in the skiathlon fall — a testament to her toughness but also a potential fatigue/injury factor for today's race
4. **Distance freestyle is her discipline:** This is the format and technique where Diggins is at her very best
5. **Mental health advocate:** Eating disorder survivor who wrote "Brave Enough" to help others
6. **The Glitter Fairy:** Biodegradable glitter before every race — her signature
7. **Val di Fiemme memories:** Won 2013 World Championship gold at this venue with Randall
8. **2018 flashback:** That team sprint gold with Randall — one of the great American Olympic moments
9. **Late start advantage:** BIB 44 means she knows every split time before she pushes off
