## Personal Life & Background

- **Hometown/birthplace:** Born and raised in **Fairbanks, Alaska**. Grew up skiing at Birch Hill, the home trails of the Nordic Ski Club of Fairbanks. All of her family lives in Fairbanks. ([Alaska Public Media](https://alaskapublic.org/news/alaska-desk/2026-02-04/fairbanks-olympian-says-shes-determined-to-make-her-hometown-proud))
- **Family:** Her father, **Mike Kramer**, grew up in Fairbanks and was a runner at Washington State University in the late 1980s. Her mother, **Susan Schwartz**, does not ski but administers the Nordic Ski Club of Fairbanks' Junior Nordics program.

- **How she started skiing:** Kramer was a runner first. When her best friend joined the Nordic Ski Club of Fairbanks' advanced FXC program for strength training purposes, Kramer decided to try it out. She went on to ski for West Valley High School. ([Nordic Insights](https://nordicinsights.news/2024/11/27/kendall-kramer-on-her-last-xc-race/); [Alaska Sports Report](https://alaskasportsreport.com/2020/04/kramer-to-stay-local-ski-and-run-for-uaf/))
- **Education:** Graduated from **West Valley High School** in Fairbanks, where she won 14 state championships combined in skiing and running. Attended the **University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF)**, graduating with a degree in biology and psychology. She was an eight-time NCAA All-American -- five in skiing, three in cross-country running. ([Alaska Nanooks Athletics](https://alaskananooks.com/sports/womens-cross-country/roster/kendall-kramer/3655); [UAF Aurora Magazine](https://www.uaf.edu/aurora/archives/summer-2025/skiing-out-the-door-and-ahead-of-the-competition.php))
- **Hobbies/interests:** Kramer is an elite cross-country runner alongside her skiing career. She was the NCAA Division II national runner-up in cross-country running in November 2024 -- the highest placement in UAF Nanook history. She has described the two sports as inseparable parts of her athletic identity. ([Alaska Nanooks Athletics](https://alaskananooks.com/sports/womens-cross-country/roster/kendall-kramer/3655))
- **Quotes:**
  - *"I was a runner first and got into skiing and I feel XC culture defines me as an athlete and I carry it into skiing, as opposed to the other way around."* ([Nordic Insights](https://nordicinsights.news/2024/11/27/kendall-kramer-on-her-last-xc-race/))
  - *"I can't imagine doing one without the other."* -- on the relationship between running and skiing. ([Nordic Insights](https://nordicinsights.news/2024/11/27/kendall-kramer-on-her-last-xc-race/))
- **Personality/reputation:** Kramer's decision to stay in Fairbanks and attend UAF -- rather than move to a larger program in the Lower 48 -- has had a transformative effect on the local skiing community. Her success led to UAF adding four more female skiers to the program, and her coach credits her with making it "cool for locals to stay and go to Alaska colleges." She was named an NCAA Woman of the Year finalist in 2025 and is now sponsored by Rossignol as she transitions to professional skiing.

## Key Storylines
Kendall Kramer is making her Olympic debut at Milano Cortina 2026 at age 23, representing her hometown of Fairbanks, Alaska. A remarkably versatile athlete, she was an eight-time NCAA All-American in both skiing and running at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, culminating in an NCAA skiing national championship in March 2025. Her career-best World Cup result of 18th came in a 10km freestyle race at Cogne -- the exact same discipline she faces here. Kramer's rapid development from collegiate standout to Olympian has been one of the feel-good stories of American cross-country skiing this season.
