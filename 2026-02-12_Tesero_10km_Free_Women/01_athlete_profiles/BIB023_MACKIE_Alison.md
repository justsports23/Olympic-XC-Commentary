## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Origins
Alison Mackie was born on October 8, 2005, in **Edmonton, Alberta**, Canada. She grew up in Edmonton and now lives and trains in **Canmore** at the **Alberta World Cup Academy (AWCA)**, which had seven club athletes qualify for the 2026 Winter Olympics ([Rocky Mountain News](https://www.rmoutlook.com/2026-olympics/alison-mackie-bow-valley-olympian-at-milano-cortina-2026-11825493)).

### Family & How She Started Skiing
Skiing was a family affair from the very beginning. *"My parents had me on skis as soon as I could walk,"* Mackie recalled. *"They both grew up skiing, but not really racing, and they wanted it to be part of my childhood."* ([Nordiq Canada](https://nordiqcanada.ca/news-item/catching-up-with-alison-mackie-a-conversation-on-belief-breakthroughs-and-the-road-to-the-olympics/)) Her journey started on the snowy trails of **Gold Bar Park** in Edmonton. She competed in her first Alberta Cup race at age 7 and began racing regularly around the province by age 10 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Mackie)).

### Growing Up with the Olympics
Mackie grew up watching the Olympic Games with her family, and the dream of competing on that stage took root early. She is the youngest Canadian Olympic cross-country skier since Turin 2006 ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/alison-mackie/)).

### RED-S Recovery & Resilience
During the 2023-24 season, Mackie struggled with **Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)**. Her training load had increased drastically, but she was unaware of how much more fuel her body needed, leading to consistent sickness and physical issues. At the 2024 World Juniors in Planica, she became ill and missed all but one race while her teammates excelled. *"In that moment, it was hard seeing all my teammates doing so well and not even being able to celebrate with them,"* she said. But the setback fueled her: *"My inability to race that year really lit my fire. I left the past in the past and focused on what I can control, which is myself and how I prepare."* ([Nordiq Canada](https://nordiqcanada.ca/news-item/catching-up-with-alison-mackie-a-conversation-on-belief-breakthroughs-and-the-road-to-the-olympics/))

### Personality & Values
Mackie embodies a community-minded ethos. *"I'm proud to represent everyone who has helped me get to where I am today,"* she said. *"Whether it be my family or my community back in Edmonton, my coaches..."* ([Nordiq Canada](https://nordiqcanada.ca/news-item/catching-up-with-alison-mackie-a-conversation-on-belief-breakthroughs-and-the-road-to-the-olympics/)) On her Olympic dream, she said: *"It's more about showing myself that I can do anything I set my mind to... and that all my determination and hard work has paid off."* ([Rocky Mountain News](https://www.rmoutlook.com/2026-olympics/confidence-builds-for-canmore-based-skiers-olympic-debut-after-historic-tour-de-ski-11705834))

## Key Storylines
- **Rising star at just 20 years old:** Mackie is the top-ranked U23 woman in the world this season and the youngest Canadian Olympic cross-country skier since Turin 2006. She has rocketed from Junior Worlds to World Cup top-10 results in just one season. ([Rocky Mountain News](https://www.rmoutlook.com/2026-olympics/alison-mackie-22nd-in-winter-olympics-debut-katherine-stewart-jones-45th-in-skiathlon-11850589))
- **RED-S recovery:** During the 2023-24 season, Mackie struggled with Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S). Her training load had increased drastically, but she was unaware of how much more fuel her body needed, leading to consistent sickness. Her bounce-back has been remarkable — from illness-plagued Junior Worlds in 2024 (53rd in sprint) to double Junior Worlds medalist in 2025. ([Nordiq Canada](https://nordiqcanada.ca/news-item/catching-up-with-alison-mackie-a-conversation-on-belief-breakthroughs-and-the-road-to-the-olympics/))

- **Freestyle race favors her:** The 10 km free format plays directly to one of Mackie's strongest techniques. Her 5th-place Tour de Ski result was in a freestyle stage, and she medaled in the 10 km free at Junior Worlds. ([FIS Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=CC&raceid=49549))
- **Family roots in skiing:** Skiing was a family affair, starting on the trails of Gold Bar Park in Edmonton. She competed in her first Alberta Cup race at age 7. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Mackie))
