## Personal Life & Background
- **Birthplace & Hometown:** Born and raised in St. Moritz, in the Engadin valley of Graubunden (Grisons) canton, Switzerland. She grew up surrounded by the ski trails around Silvaplana and St. Moritz, and knows the Engadin cross-country courses intimately -- "I actually really know every corner," she has said [blue News — Home World Cup for Kaelin sisters](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/a-real-home-world-cup-for-sisters-marina-and-nadja-kaelin-2532947.html)
- **Family / Sister Marina Kaelin:** Nadja has a younger sister, Marina Kaelin (born ~2003), who is also a competitive cross-country skier. Marina won gold at the 2024 U23 World Championships in Planica in the 20km skating mass start. Both sisters were selected for the 2026 Swiss Olympic team. Nadja felt significant pressure during the Olympic selection period -- not primarily for herself, but out of concern for whether Marina would also make the team. In the end, both sisters earned their Olympic spots [blue News — Home World Cup for Kaelin sisters](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/a-real-home-world-cup-for-sisters-marina-and-nadja-kaelin-2532947.html) [blue News — Kaelin is Switzerland's Greatest Hope](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/index/nadja-kaelin-is-switzerlands-greatest-hope-in-the-skiathlon-3084952.html)
- **How She Started Skiing:** Growing up in St. Moritz, Kaelin originally began with Alpine skiing, which is the dominant skiing culture in the Engadin. Her parents then introduced her to cross-country skiing, and she preferred it. She has noted that people always say she is good in the downhill sections, which she attributes to her early Alpine skiing background [Wikipedia — Nadja Kalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadja_K%C3%A4lin) [blue News — Kaelin is Switzerland's Greatest Hope](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/index/nadja-kaelin-is-switzerlands-greatest-hope-in-the-skiathlon-3084952.html)
- **Training Base:** A few years ago, both Nadja and Marina moved their training base from the Upper Engadine to Davos, where they train under coach Karoline Braaten Guidon alongside other Swiss national team members. Marina has noted that while "the altitude is even better in the Engadin than in Davos," the snow farming infrastructure and access to national squad training partners in Davos were decisive advantages [blue News — Home World Cup for Kaelin sisters](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/a-real-home-world-cup-for-sisters-marina-and-nadja-kaelin-2532947.html) [blue News — Kaelin is Switzerland's Greatest Hope](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/index/nadja-kaelin-is-switzerlands-greatest-hope-in-the-skiathlon-3084952.html)

- **Notable Quote:** After her 4th-place finish at the 2026 Olympic skiathlon, Kaelin declared: "They always say that fourth place is the first to lose, but I definitely won 4th place today" [blue News — "I won a 4th place"](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/nadja-kaelin-i-won-a-4th-place-3086096.html)

- **Freestyle strength:** Strong — her Olympic skiathlon surge came in the skating portion, moving from 7th at halfway to 4th; best results in freestyle formats ([NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-switzerland-dazzled-by-nadja-kaelins-fourth-place-in-the-skiathlon-0207/))

## Key Storylines
- **Breakthrough Olympic performance:** Her 4th place in the skiathlon on Feb 7 was a massive breakout result. She declared: "They always say that fourth place is the first to lose, but I definitely won 4th place today." She was just 25 seconds from a historic Swiss medal. ([blue News — "I won a 4th place"](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/nadja-kaelin-i-won-a-4th-place-3086096.html))
- **Rapid development trajectory:** From 69th at her WC debut in 2021, to 21st at the 2022 Olympics, to 6th at the 2025 Worlds, to 4th at these Olympics — Kaelin's improvement curve is dramatic. At just 24, she is entering her prime years. ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/kaelin-sui-stole-skiathlon-show-with-sixth-place-surprise-it-is-my-best-race-for-sure-))
- **Swiss distance skiing renaissance:** Swiss cross-country has historically been sprint-dominated (Nadine Fahndrich). Kaelin is emerging as Switzerland's first serious women's distance threat in decades. Her 4th was the best Swiss women's individual Olympic XC result since 1988. ([NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-switzerland-dazzled-by-nadja-kaelins-fourth-place-in-the-skiathlon-0207/))
- **Engadin roots:** Born and raised in St. Moritz, she grew up surrounded by Alpine skiing culture but chose cross-country. She trains in Davos with her sister Marina Kaelin under coach Karoline Braaten Guidon. ([blue News](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/index/nadja-kaelin-is-switzerlands-greatest-hope-in-the-skiathlon-3084952.html))
- **Confidence from the skiathlon:** Arriving at the 10km free just five days after her best-ever result, Kaelin carries enormous confidence and momentum. The question is whether she can replicate that form in a pure freestyle interval start.
- **DNF at Goms a concern:** She did not finish the 20km classic mass start at Goms on Jan 25, two weeks before the Olympics. The reason for the DNF is not confirmed. [UNVERIFIED — possible tactical withdrawal or fatigue management]
