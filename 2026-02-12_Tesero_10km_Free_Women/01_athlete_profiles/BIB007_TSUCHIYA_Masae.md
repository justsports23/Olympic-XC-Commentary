## Key Storylines
Masae Tsuchiya is the most experienced athlete in this group of five at age 29, making her second Olympic appearance after Beijing 2022. Representing the HIROKA Ski Racing Club from Iwate Prefecture, she is one of Japan's leading distance skiers. Her 8th-place finish at a FIS race in Gallivare in November 2025 suggests she entered the Olympic season in good form at the FIS level, even if World Cup results have been more modest. Her World Championship appearance in Planica (29th) was a solid result, and her skiathlon performance at Tesero earlier this week gives her fresh knowledge of the course conditions. With the best FIS distance points (59.62) among this group of five athletes, Tsuchiya has the strongest points-based ranking and could be the most competitive of these early bibs.
