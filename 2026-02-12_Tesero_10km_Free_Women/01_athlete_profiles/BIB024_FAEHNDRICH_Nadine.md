# Nadine FAEHNDRICH (SUI)
**Pronunciation:** *nah-DEEN FEND-rish*
**Bib:** 24 | **Start Time:** 13:12:00 | **FIS Code:** 162603 | **DOB:** October 16, 1995 (age 30) | **Born:** Schwarzenberg, Switzerland
**FIS Distance Points:** 34.69
**Club:** Skiclub Horw | **National Team:** Switzerland A-Team
**Equipment:** Salomon skis, KV+ poles

**Event:** Women's 10km Interval Start Free

## Event Context: 10km Interval Start Freestyle

This is a **distance freestyle** race — a significant shift from the sprint classic where Faehndrich is most dangerous. While she is primarily a sprint specialist (#2 in Sprint World Cup standings), this 10km individual time trial in skating technique tests a different set of demands. Her FIS Distance Points of 34.69 place her outside the elite distance tier, but her raw fitness, freestyle ability (Davos 3rd in freestyle sprint, 2025 WC bronze in freestyle sprint), and familiarity with the Tesero venue give her a foundation. The question is whether her sprint-oriented engine can sustain a 10km effort at the sharp end.

## The Person Behind the Skis

### A Skiing Family at the Foot of Mount Pilatus
Nadine grew up in **Eigenthal**, a district of Schwarzenberg in the canton of Lucerne — nestled at the foot of the iconic **Mount Pilatus** with a 15-kilometer trail literally at her doorstep. Both her parents, **Kurt and Kaethy Faehndrich**, are deeply involved in cross-country skiing — with organizational and community roles in the sport — and had their daughter on skis from a young age. — [xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/) [Note: "started skiing at age 2" is UNVERIFIED; the parents' roles appear more organizational than competitive]

Her younger brother **Cyril Faehndrich** (born 1999) is also a professional cross-country skier. The two train together closely under private coach **Ivan Hudac**, who says of the sibling bond: *"The symbiosis is very strong."* Nadine agrees: *"We can benefit from this immensely."* — [xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/)

She joined **Skiclub Horw** at a young age and considers the club *"the foundation of everything"* — a lifelong connection to her local community.

### Heart Surgery — Racing Two Weeks Later
In **February 2024**, during a World Cup race in Canmore, Canada, heart rate monitor data revealed **cardiac arrhythmia** — extra heartbeats that had been detected during her junior years but were considered benign. After returning to Switzerland, stress testing led doctors to perform **heart surgery in March 2024**.

The remarkable part: **just two weeks after surgery**, Faehndrich returned to World Cup racing and finished fifth. After the procedure, the extra heartbeats became much less frequent, and symptoms like dizziness nearly disappeared. — [Sportlerin Magazin](https://www.sportlerin-magazin.ch/post/nadine-faehndrich)

### The Self-Described Classic Specialist
Faehndrich has spoken openly about her technique identity: *"This year I felt better in classic."* [UNVERIFIED — attributed in preview document; original source not located] She considers herself a **classic specialist** who has expanded to freestyle — the exact opposite of most modern sprint specialists. On the Tesero Olympic course, she reportedly said: *"The course is really fun to ski."* [UNVERIFIED — original source not located]

## The Classic Queen of Val di Fiemme (Sprint Context)

### Two Years, Two Podiums on the Olympic Course
Faehndrich has an extraordinary record at Val di Fiemme in classic sprints:
- **January 2025 (TdS):** Won the classic sprint — her first World Cup victory in nearly 3 years
- **January 2026 (TdS):** 2nd place, just 0.44 seconds behind Joensuu

No athlete in the field has a better two-year classic sprint record on this specific course.

She has described these Olympics as her opportunity to deliver her **"masterpiece"** — [SRF Sport](https://www.srf.ch/sport/milano-cortina-2026/langlauf-sprints-bei-olympia-wie-im-traum-faehndrich-will-unverhoffte-medaillen-chance-nutzen)

## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Origins
Nadine Faehndrich was born on October 16, 1995, in **Schwarzenberg** in the canton of Lucerne. She grew up in **Eigenthal**, a district of Schwarzenberg nestled at the foot of the iconic **Mount Pilatus**, with a 15-kilometer cross-country trail literally at her doorstep ([xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/)). In the summer of 2023, she moved into a newly built apartment in **Knutwil**, about 40 kilometers north of her hometown, with a view of the Jungfrau ([xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/)).

### Family
Both her parents, **Kurt and Kaethy Faehndrich**, are deeply involved in cross-country skiing with organizational and community roles in the sport, and had Nadine on skis from a young age ([xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/)). Her younger brother **Cyril Faehndrich** (born 1999) is also a professional cross-country skier. The two train together closely under private coach **Ivan Hudac**, who says of the sibling bond: *"The symbiosis is very strong."* Nadine agrees: *"We can benefit from this immensely."* ([xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/))

### How She Started Skiing
Even as a kindergartener, Nadine always wanted to be taken along to races and stood at the course for years cheering on the runners -- though her father would not let her compete for a long time. In 2012, after a medal at the Swiss Junior Championships and several top-10 placements at the Youth Olympic Winter Games in Innsbruck, she earned her first squad placement with Swiss-Ski at the age of 16 ([xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/)). She joined **Skiclub Horw** at a young age and considers the club *"the foundation of everything"* -- a lifelong connection to her local community.

### Partner
Faehndrich is in a long-term relationship with **Elvis Fazliu**, a surgical nurse from Basel whom she met in 2015 while going out in Lucerne. Fazliu had no prior connection to cross-country skiing. The couple lived together in the Basel region in Allschwil before moving to Knutwil in 2023 ([xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/)).

### Education
Faehndrich completed a **commercial apprenticeship with a vocational baccalaureate** (Kauffrau mit Berufsmaturitat) before becoming a full-time professional cross-country skier with the Swiss-Ski national team ([xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/)).

### Hobbies
Her hobbies include sport, friends, and **sauna** -- her five-room apartment in Knutwil finally has space for a sauna, which she regularly uses for relaxation and recovery ([xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/)).

### Heart Surgery
In **February 2024**, during a World Cup race in Canmore, Canada, heart rate monitor data revealed **cardiac arrhythmia** -- extra heartbeats that had been detected during her junior years but were considered benign. After returning to Switzerland, stress testing led doctors to perform **heart surgery in March 2024**. Remarkably, just **two weeks after surgery**, she returned to World Cup racing and finished fifth. After the procedure, the extra heartbeats became much less frequent, and symptoms like dizziness nearly disappeared ([Sportlerin Magazin](https://www.sportlerin-magazin.ch/post/nadine-faehndrich)).

### Physical Stats
She stands 169 cm tall and weighs 62 kg ([xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/)).

## Career Highlights
- **World Cup victories:** 6 individual (all sprints)
- **2025 World Championship:** Bronze (Individual Sprint Freestyle), Bronze (Team Sprint Classic w/ Weber)
- **2021 World Championship:** Silver (Team Sprint w/ van der Graaff)
- **Beijing 2022 Olympics:** 5th in Sprint Classic (missed bronze by 4 seconds)
- **2025 Engadin Ski Marathon:** Winner
- **2025 TdS Sprint Classic (Val di Fiemme):** Winner — on this exact course

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Elite — self-described classic specialist; won Val di Fiemme TdS classic sprint 2025
- **Freestyle strength:** Strong — 2025 WC bronze in freestyle sprint, Davos 3rd in freestyle sprint this season
- **Sprint ability:** Top 3 in the world; #2 in Sprint WC standings
- **Distance assessment (10km Free context):** This is outside Faehndrich's primary comfort zone. Her FIS Distance Points of 34.69 indicate she is not a regular distance contender. However, her Engadin Ski Marathon victory (2025) proved she has endurance over longer distances. The 10km is the shortest distance event — close enough to sprint territory that her speed could be a factor, especially on a technical course. Her freestyle sprint results (Davos 3rd, WC bronze) confirm she can skate effectively.
- **Climbing ability:** Strong classic technique translates well on the Tesero climbs
- **Best format:** Sprint — the 10km interval start is a different challenge, but her fitness base from sprint training and marathon racing could translate

## Venue History
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-------|
| Jan 3, 2025 | TdS | Sprint Classic | **1st** | Won on the Olympic course (2024-25 season) |
| Jan 3, 2026 | TdS | Sprint Classic | **2nd** | +0.44s behind Joensuu; ON OLYMPIC COURSE |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Olympics | Sprint Classic | QF elim. (~21st) | Qual 5th; eliminated in QF2 behind Svahn and Ganz |

## Key Storylines
1. **Sprint specialist in a distance race:** Can she translate her explosive speed to a 10km effort?
2. **Heart surgery to Olympic medal contender:** Had cardiac surgery in March 2024, raced two weeks later
3. **The "masterpiece":** Her own word for what she's seeking at these Olympics
4. **Brother bond:** Trains with brother Cyril under coach Hudac — family-powered pursuit of Olympic glory
5. **Beijing heartbreak:** 5th in Sprint Classic at Beijing 2022 (missed bronze by 4s) — unfinished business
6. **Olympic sprint 2 days ago (Feb 10):** Qualified 5th in the classic sprint but was eliminated in QF2 (behind Svahn and Ganz). Another Olympic sprint disappointment after Beijing's 5th place. Now racing the 10km free just 2 days later — the sprint effort and emotional letdown could be a factor
7. **Engadin Marathon winner:** Proved she has endurance well beyond sprint distance

## Commentary Gold
- **Heart surgery then back racing in two weeks** — one of the most remarkable medical comeback stories in the field
- Grew up at the **foot of Mount Pilatus** with trails at her doorstep — a Swiss postcard childhood
- Trains with her **brother Cyril** — the sibling bond is "very strong"
- Considers Skiclub Horw *"the foundation of everything"* — deep community roots
- 5th at Beijing 2022 by 4 seconds — she's been visualizing this Olympic redemption for four years
- **Engadin Marathon winner** — if she can win a 42km race, she can handle 10km
- The 10km is the shortest distance event — the line between sprint fitness and distance fitness is thinnest here
- If she podiums, it would be a breakthrough result for a sprint specialist in a distance event
