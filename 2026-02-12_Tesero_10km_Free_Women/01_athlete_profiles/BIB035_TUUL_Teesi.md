## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Upbringing
Teesi Tuul was born on 31 August 1999 and grew up in Viljandimaa (Viljandi County), Estonia, where she began her sporting journey under the legendary Estonian ski coach Urve Bergmann. She currently belongs to the ski club Pohjakotkas. ([Farron.ee](https://farron.ee/blog/post/teesi-tuul-voitis-naistest-tanavuse-tartu-maratoni))

### Education
Tuul's desire and dream to ski at a higher level began in high school, which led her to study at Audentese Spordigumnaasium (Audentese Sports Gymnasium), Estonia's elite sports academy in Tallinn. However, the heavy training loads there initially took a toll on her health, and results were limited during that period. Upon entering university, more opportunities arose, and consistent training bore fruit -- her first victories encouraged her to continue and aim even higher.

### Hobbies & Lifestyle

Tuul also participates in the Ski Classics pro series, racing for Team Fikala. ([Farron.ee](https://farron.ee/blog/post/teesi-tuul-voitis-naistest-tanavuse-tartu-maratoni))

### Notable Stories -- 50th Tartu Marathon
Tuul's most celebrated moment came at the 50th anniversary Tartu Maraton, Estonia's most prestigious cross-country ski race (63km), where she won the women's race in a dramatic final sprint with a time of 2:53:04.3. After the race, she declared: *"I came to the start with victory in my mind, and I dare say that I had the best skis today."* She noted she was the only one among the leading women who used grip wax. She added: *"Winning the jubilee marathon is a very powerful feeling."* ([Worldloppet](https://www.worldloppet.com/50-tartu-maraton-was-won-by-henri-roos-with-the-new-course-record/))
