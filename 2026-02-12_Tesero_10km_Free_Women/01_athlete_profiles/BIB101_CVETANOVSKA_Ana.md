## Personal Life & Background
Ana Cvetanovska was born on 6 December 2000 and hails from **Skopje**, the capital of North Macedonia ([Olympics.com — Ana Cvetanovska](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/ana-cvetanovska)). The surname Cvetanovska is among the most widely held in North Macedonia, borne by approximately 2,397 people in the country, with roughly 59 percent concentrated in the Skopje region ([Forebears.io — Cvetanovska](https://forebears.io/surnames/cvetanovska)). Cvetanovska is a trailblazer for female endurance athletes in North Macedonia, a country where cross-country skiing infrastructure is extremely limited. While downhill skiing options exist in the country (at resorts like Popova Sapka and Mavrovo), finding cross-country ski instructors or groomed trails is very difficult ([Midlife Crisis Odyssey — Cross Country Skiing in North Macedonia](https://midlifecrisisodyssey.com/cross-country-skiing/)). Despite these challenges, she has persisted in the sport and qualified for two consecutive Olympics. She is one of four athletes representing North Macedonia at Milano Cortina 2026, alongside cross-country skier Stavre Jada and alpine skiers ([MIA.mk](https://mia.mk/en/story/four-macedonian-athletes-to-compete-at-2026-winter-olympics%C2%A0)). North Macedonia has never won an Olympic Winter Games medal. [DATA NOT FOUND] regarding her family, education, or how she started skiing.
