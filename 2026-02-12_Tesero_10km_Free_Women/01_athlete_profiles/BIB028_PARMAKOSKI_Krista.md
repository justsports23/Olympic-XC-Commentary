## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Origins
Krista Parmakoski (nee **Lahteenmaki**) was born on December 12, 1990, in **Ikaalinen**, a small town in the Pirkanmaa region of western Finland ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krista_P%C3%A4rm%C3%A4koski)). She grew up on a family farm and has described an active rural childhood: *"I've always been very active, helping my dad with all the duties he had at our farm."* She recalls carrying stones from the fields -- *"stones about the size of my head by hand, while the bigger ones were moved by my dad with a tractor"* -- and believes that is where her guts and strength come from ([PeoplePill](https://peoplepill.com/i/krista-paermaekoski/)). She stands 160 cm (5'2") tall and resides in **Kuortane**, South Ostrobothnia ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krista_P%C3%A4rm%C3%A4koski)).

### How She Started Skiing
Parmakoski has been skiing since childhood but started competing at the age of 12. By 16, she was competing throughout Finland and attracting the attention of the national team selectors. She officially debuted on the Finnish national team in 2009, at age 18 ([PeoplePill](https://peoplepill.com/i/krista-paermaekoski/)). She represents her hometown club, **Ikaalisten Urheilijat**, maintaining a lifelong connection to her roots.

### Marriage, Divorce & Personal Struggles
In August 2014, Parmakoski married **Tommi Parmakoski**, a sports trainer who had served as the physical trainer for four-time Formula 1 champion Sebastian Vettel from 2008 to 2011, and has also worked with Finnish ice hockey teams Pelicans and Tappara in the top league ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/cross-country-star-divorces-after-10-years/)). After 10 years of marriage, the couple announced their separation in 2024. In a joint Instagram statement, they wrote: *"After amazing and sometimes eventful years together, we have decided to move separate ways. The past years held all kinds of adventures, and we are grateful for these years... there is still an understanding and appreciation for each other, and we will move on as friends."* ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/cross-country-star-divorces-after-10-years/)) The divorce was officially granted in April 2025.

After the divorce, Parmakoski chose to keep her married surname, explaining: *"It was part of my life at the time and part of me. I've built my brand with that surname."* She added: *"My career doesn't have long left, so we'll see after that which surname I'll end up with."* ([Iltalehti (Finnish tabloid)](https://www.iltalehti.fi/talviurheilu/a/1297371c-d4b3-46ec-8fbd-73b16d3fac79))

### The Crisis Year of 2023
In her autobiography **"Avoin"** (meaning "Open"), published in Finland, Parmakoski revealed the hidden struggles behind her public persona. The year 2023 became a personal crisis:
- It began with the **death of her beloved dog Carla**, which devastated her emotionally ([ski-nordique.net](https://www.ski-nordique.net/sa-vie-etait-devenue-un-veritable-enfer.6694537-72348.html))
- She was diagnosed with signs of **endometriosis**, a condition that complicated her dream of starting a family. After the death of Carla, she and Tommi decided to stop trying to have a child -- described as *"a big blow"* ([ski-nordique.net](https://www.ski-nordique.net/sa-vie-etait-devenue-un-veritable-enfer.6694537-72348.html))
- She described a difficult atmosphere within the Finnish national team, recounting how in 2019 she increasingly felt like a stranger within her own group, sometimes feeling like a burden and even dreading communal meals ([ski-nordique.net](https://www.ski-nordique.net/sa-vie-etait-devenue-un-veritable-enfer.6694537-72348.html))
- The divorce and constant competition pressure created an overwhelming combination

### Recovery & Renewal
Freed from the national team structure, Parmakoski now trains independently with people she values. Twelve months after the death of her dog Carla, she came back to win the **20km classic at Lahti in March 2024** -- her first World Cup victory in six years -- almost as a surprise. The comeback proved she still had competitive fire ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/parmakoski-wins-the-20km-race-at-the-lahti-world-cup/)).

### Equipment & Lifelong Brand Loyalty
Her bond with ski manufacturer **Madshus** is a lifelong story. Parmakoski has said: *"My very first skis, which were so-called combi-skis, were Madshus skis. All of my skis have been the same brand ever since my childhood."* ([Madshus](https://madshus.com/en-de/blog/p/krista-parmakoski-renews-her-contract-with-madshus-through-the-2022-olympics))

### Public Profile
Parmakoski is **Finland's most googled female athlete**, with an average of 53,100 monthly searches for her name -- a reflection of her celebrity status in a country where cross-country skiing is deeply embedded in the national identity ([Various Finnish media reports]).

### Farewell Season & Flag Bearer
In November 2025, Parmakoski announced that the 2025-26 season would be her last. These are her **fifth and final Olympic Games**. She was named **Finland's flag bearer** for the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony alongside hockey player Mikko Lehtonen. She said: *"I will carry the Finnish flag with pride. These are the last major competitions of my career and I am deeply grateful to have been given this honour."* ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-krista-parmakoski-named-finlands-flag-bearer-for-her-last-olympic-games-0202/))

**Season assessment:** Parmakoski's season has been characterized by mid-pack World Cup results (10th-40th range) and a strategic withdrawal from the Tour de Ski, suggesting she is managing her body carefully in her final season. Her best result was 10th at [Ruka on home snow](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/ruka-women-s-10km), an emotional farewell to Finnish fans. She has historically peaked at major championships and may be saving her best form for the Olympic distance events.

## Key Storylines
- **FAREWELL SEASON -- FINAL OLYMPIC RACE(S):** Parmakoski [announced in November 2025](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-like-jessie-diggins-finlands-krista-parmakoski-will-retire-at-the-end-of-the-season-1127/) that the 2025-26 season would be her last. These Olympic Games are her fifth and final. She said: ["I will carry the Finnish flag with pride. These are the last major competitions of my career and I am deeply grateful to have been given this honour."](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-krista-parmakoski-named-finlands-flag-bearer-for-her-last-olympic-games-0202/)
- **Finland's flag bearer:** Named [Finland's flag bearer for the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-krista-parmakoski-named-finlands-flag-bearer-for-her-last-olympic-games-0202/) alongside hockey player Mikko Lehtonen -- a recognition of her legendary status in Finnish sport.
- **Championship pedigree:** Parmakoski has historically elevated her performance at major championships. Her five Olympic medals and seven World Championship medals demonstrate an ability to peak when it matters most. Even in a season of modest World Cup results, she cannot be underestimated.
- **The Lahti redemption story:** After nearly retiring in spring 2023, Parmakoski returned to win the [20km classic at Lahti in March 2024](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/parmakoski-wins-the-20km-race-at-the-lahti-world-cup/) -- her first World Cup victory in six years -- proving she still had the competitive fire.
- **Strategic Tour de Ski withdrawal:** Her [withdrawal from the Tour de Ski](https://etusuora.com/uutiset/krista-parmakoski-keskeyttaa-tour-de-ski-2025-2026) after the Toblach stages (before the Val di Fiemme stages) suggests strategic management of her body for the Olympics, rather than going all-out in a stage race.
- **10km free at this venue:** Today's race is a pure freestyle distance event -- one of Parmakoski's strongest formats. She won Olympic bronze in the 10km free at PyeongChang 2018, and her bib number 28 (reflecting her strong FIS points) gives her a favorable start position in the interval start format.
- **Emotional farewell:** With the Ruka crowd already making an emotional farewell and media coverage framing this as her last season, every race carries additional significance. Heidi Weng noted at Ruka: ["Maybe it's because it's the last time they will see Krista here in the World Cup."](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/ruka-women-s-10km)
- **12 championship medals:** Her combined 12 medals from Olympics and World Championships make her one of the [most successful Finnish cross-country skiers of the 21st century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krista_P%C3%A4rm%C3%A4koski).
