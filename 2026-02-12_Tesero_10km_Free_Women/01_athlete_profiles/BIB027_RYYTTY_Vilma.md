### How She Started Skiing
Ryytty emerged through the Finnish domestic competition circuit and U23 development pathway. She competed at the U23 World Championships in Planica (2024), finishing 21st in the 20km ([FIS Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=CC&raceid=44498)).

Her first Olympic Games at Milano Cortina 2026 represent a breakthrough moment for a quietly rising talent ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/45329)).

## Career Highlights
- **Olympic Games:** Milano Cortina 2026 is her first Olympic Games. Finished an impressive **15th in the skiathlon** (57:37.3, +3:52.1) on Feb 7, 2026 — a strong Olympic debut ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/ccs/ms/w/skiathln----------/fnl-/000100--/race-result)).

- **World Cup Podiums/Wins:** 0

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Competent — Finnish Championship skiathlon winner (which includes 10km classic), and finished 19th in the 10km classic at Trondheim WC (Dec 2025). Her DNF in the 20km classic mass start at Goms (Jan 2026) is a concern.
- **Freestyle strength:** This is her stronger technique. Best WC results have come in freestyle events: 12th in 10km F mass start at Val di Fiemme (TdS), 16th in 10km F at Trondheim. Her FIS distance points (30.10) are driven largely by freestyle performances.
- **Sprint ability:** Limited — FIS Sprint points of 144.39. Not a factor in sprint racing.
- **Distance preference:** Middle to long distance (10km-50km). Competitive across distance formats but best over 10-20km.
- **Best format:** Mass start and pursuit, where she has shown her best results (12th in mass start at TdS, 15th in Olympic skiathlon). Also competitive in interval starts (16th in 10km F at Trondheim).
- **Climbing ability:** [UNVERIFIED] — Her strong performance at the Tour de Ski Val di Fiemme stage (which includes the famous Alpe Cermis climb) suggests decent climbing ability. Finished 12th on that stage.

## Venue History
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Time Back |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2026-01-04 | Tour de Ski Finale | 10km F Mass Start, Val di Fiemme | **12th** | — |
| 2026-02-07 | Olympic Games | Skiathlon 10/10km C/F, Tesero | **15th** | +3:52.1 |

Ryytty has strong recent venue familiarity at Val di Fiemme / Tesero. Her 12th-place Tour de Ski finale (Jan 2026) and 15th-place Olympic skiathlon (Feb 7, 2026) demonstrate she races well at this venue. ([FIS Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=222227&type=result), [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/ccs/ms/w/skiathln----------/fnl-/000100--/race-result))

## Key Storylines
- **Breakout Olympic Performance:** Ryytty's 15th-place finish in the Olympic skiathlon on Feb 7 was a career-best result at the highest level. At just 24 years old and in her first Olympics, she demonstrated that she belongs among the world's top distance skiers. This gives her strong momentum heading into the 10km freestyle ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/45329)).
- **Finnish Championship Pedigree:** Winning the skiathlon at the Finnish Championships in January 2025, beating established names like Anne Kyllonen, signaled her arrival as a top Finnish distance talent ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-imatra-vilma-ryytty-wins-the-skiathlon-at-the-finnish-championships-0112/)).
- **Freestyle Specialist:** Her best results consistently come in freestyle events, making the 10km freestyle interval start a natural fit for her skillset.
- **Goms DNF Concern:** Her DNF in the 20km classic mass start at Goms (Jan 25, 2026) — just two weeks before the Olympics — raises questions about her physical condition. However, the skiathlon result five days ago suggests she has bounced back strongly.
- **Rising Trajectory:** From U23 Worlds (21st at Planica 2024) to Finnish Championship winner to Olympic top-15 in the skiathlon — Ryytty's progression has been rapid and consistent.
- **Venue Confidence:** Having raced twice at Tesero/Val di Fiemme this season (Tour de Ski and skiathlon), she has valuable course familiarity. Her 12th-place Tour de Ski finish at this venue is her best World Cup-level result of the season.
