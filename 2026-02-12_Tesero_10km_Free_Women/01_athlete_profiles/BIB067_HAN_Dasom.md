## Personal Life & Background
Han Dasom (Korean: 한다솜) was born on October 22, 1994, in Pyeongchang, South Korea -- the same region that hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics ([Famous Birthdays](https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/han-dasom.html)). At 31, she is the veteran leader of the Korean women's cross-country skiing team and the most experienced member of the squad. She uses Fischer skis and boots ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162284&type=result)).

Han made her Olympic debut at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, competing in the women's sprint free, skiathlon, and team sprint classic events alongside teammate Lee Eui Jin ([Olympics.com - Beijing 2022](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/cross-country-skiing/athlete-profile-n1036977-dasom-han.htm)). She has been a regular on the World Cup circuit competing in back-of-field positions, which gives her invaluable international racing experience that she brings to the Korean team ([Weltski.de](https://www.weltski.de/en/person/sp46/cross-country-skiing/pe662287/dasom-han/)).

## Key Storylines
**MAJOR:** Han and teammate Lee Eui Jin were disqualified from the sprint classic qualification on Feb 10, 2026, after their skis tested positive for fluorinated wax. The Korea Ski and Snowboard Association has disputed the findings, stating the product used was not fluorine wax and citing negative results at all previous international competitions. It remains unclear whether Han will be permitted to start the 10km free event on Feb 12. Han is the veteran leader of the Korean women's cross-country team at age 31, competing in her second Olympics.
