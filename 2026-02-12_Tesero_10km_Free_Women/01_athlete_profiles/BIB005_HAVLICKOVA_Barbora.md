- **How she started skiing:** She began cross-country skiing when she started school, joining **Skirapel Vimperk** (Fischer Ski klubu Sumava Vimperk). Her father would go skiing with her whenever he had time after work. The Sumava region's strong skiing traditions -- shared by legendary Czech skier Katerina Neumannova -- provided a natural environment for her development.

She has spoken publicly about her struggle, explaining that she had to re-learn how to eat properly, working with her mother to rebuild a healthy relationship with food and shopping. Her comeback from this period to return to the national team and compete at a second Olympics is one of the most compelling personal stories in Czech skiing.

## Key Storylines
Barbora Havlickova made headlines in 2018 as the youngest member of the Czech Olympic team at PyeongChang at just 17 years old. After a period where she was not nominated to the national team due to health concerns in 2021-22 -- including a publicly discussed eating disorder that required her to re-learn healthy eating habits with her mother's help -- she has rebuilt her career and returned to solid international form. She is also a talented mountain runner who has won at the World Mountain Running Championships at youth level. Her 2025 World Championships appearance in Trondheim -- including a strong 8th in the mixed relay -- signals her return to form. The 10km free at Tesero represents familiar territory for her distance abilities, though her skiathlon result earlier in these Games (39th) suggests she may be below peak form.
