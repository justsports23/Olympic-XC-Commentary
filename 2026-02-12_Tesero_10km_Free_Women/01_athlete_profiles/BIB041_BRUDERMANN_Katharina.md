## Technique & Format Profile
- **Freestyle strength:** Her best World Cup result (27th at Lillehammer) came in a 10km freestyle event, suggesting competence in skating
- **Distance preference:** Best suited to longer distances (skiathlon, 20km+); the 10km may be on the shorter side for her

## Venue History
No prior results at Tesero. However, she competed in the Tour de Ski stages at nearby Toblach (83rd in 10km Classic), which is in the same Dolomites region.

## Key Storylines
Brudermann is an Austrian B-Team skier making her Olympic debut at age 27. She trains extensively in Norway, even competing in Norwegian domestic championships, which speaks to her dedication to facing strong competition. Her career-best World Cup result of 27th at Lillehammer in December 2024 shows she can compete in the top tier on her best day. In a freestyle 10km interval start — a format that suits her Lillehammer result profile — she has a genuine chance to post a solid Olympic result for Austria.
