## Personal Life & Background

- **Family:** Keidy is one of three siblings who all pursued cross-country skiing. She has a twin sister, **Kaidy Kaasiku** (FIS Code 209654), who is also competing at these Olympics for Estonia, and an older brother, **Jarmo Kaasiku** (born 7 May 1999), who competed internationally for Estonia at junior level. Their father introduced them to sports at age 5, and they began cross-country skiing in the first grade, following the example of their older brother. Their grandparents live near Aravete, and the twins have spoken about how visiting them between training camps gives them fresh energy.

- **How they started skiing:** Under their father's guidance and following older brother Jarmo, the twins started ski training in first grade with coach Raido Rohi. Growing up, they tried swimming, orienteering, and athletics, but cross-country skiing fascinated them the most. They have been in the sport for over 15 years. ([Skispirit Team](https://skispirit.ee/en/meist/))
- **Education:** Keidy attended Aravete High School (Pohja-Jarva School), where she and Kaidy also got their driver's licenses. She is currently studying physical education at the **University of Tartu**.

- **Hobbies/interests:** The twins describe themselves as very family-oriented. They rarely miss a chance to go home to Aravete to visit family, and the first stop is always their grandparents' countryside home. They share an Instagram account (@kaasiku.twins).

- **Quotes:**
  - *"If I am being honest, I prefer the distance races like 10 km and skiathlon to the sprint."* ([FISU](https://www.fisu.net/2025/01/20/an-olympians-quest-for-fisu-games-excellence/))
- **Personality/reputation:** The Kaasiku twins are a well-known pair in Estonian skiing, helping to raise the profile of the sport in a smaller skiing nation. Their close bond -- living together in Tartu, traveling together, and often finishing within seconds of each other in races -- has made them a compelling story in Nordic skiing.

She is one half of the Kaasiku twins -- twin sister Kaidy (FIS Code 209654) is also competing for Estonia at these Games. A physical education student at the University of Tartu, Keidy has shown a strong upward trajectory, winning gold at the 2025 FISU World University Games and establishing herself as a regular World Cup competitor. Her distance focus and classic strength make the 10km free an interesting test of her freestyle development.
