## Personal Life & Background
- **Birthplace:** Born in Smolensk, Russia, in 2007; of Russian origin but represents Moldova in international competition ([Timpul.md](https://timpul.md/articol/purtatoarea-drapelului-moldovei-la-jo-2026-de-la-milano-acuzata-de-sustinerea-agresiunii-rusesti.html))
- **Mother:** Natalia Levcenkova (also spelled Levchenkova), a former Moldovan biathlete who competed internationally from 2003 to 2011. Levcenkova was the flag bearer for Moldova at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, where she finished 8th in the 15 km individual biathlon event — the best result in Moldova's Winter Olympic history. After Elizaveta's birth in the 2007-2008 season, Levcenkova became European champion in biathlon ([Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com/page/Moldova_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics))
- **Father:** Alexandru Hlusovici, who served as Natalia Levcenkova's coach. For the European championship achievement, both Natalia and Alexandru received monetary bonuses from the Moldovan government, and Natalia received an extraordinary military rank in the Carabinieri Troops of the Moldovan Ministry of Internal Affairs ([Adevarul.ro](https://adevarul.ro/sport/portdrapelul-moldovei-ii-face-propaganda-lui-2507412.html))
- **Family residence:** Despite representing Moldova, the family has always lived in Smolensk, Russia ([Adevarul.ro](https://adevarul.ro/sport/portdrapelul-moldovei-ii-face-propaganda-lui-2507412.html))
- **Following in her mother's footsteps:** Elizaveta chose to represent Moldova, just as her mother had done. She has expressed great emotion about her first Olympic participation, particularly given her mother's historic 8th-place finish 20 years earlier ([Moldpres](https://www.moldpres.md/eng/sport-en/photo-moldova-s-olympic-team-at-winter-olympic-games-marched-in-opening-ceremony-of-white-olympics))
- **Flag bearer:** Carried Moldova's flag at the Milano Cortina 2026 Opening Ceremony alongside Iulian Luchin ([IPN.md](https://ipn.md/en/the-flag-of-moldova-at-the-opening-ceremony-of-the-winter-olympic-games/))
- **Controversy at 2026 Olympics:** A scandal erupted when Ukrainian and Moldovan media reported that Hlusovici was a member of pro-Russian groups on the VKontakte social network, leading to accusations of supporting Russian aggression against Ukraine. The controversy also highlighted that four of Moldova's five Olympic athletes were naturalized athletes of Russian origin ([Pravda Moldova](https://md.news-pravda.com/en/russia/2026/02/10/88537.html))

## Key Storylines
At just 18 years old, Hlusovici is one of the youngest competitors in the entire Olympic cross-country skiing field. She was honored as one of Moldova's two flag bearers at the Opening Ceremony alongside fellow cross-country skier Iulian Luchin — both making their Olympic debuts. Moldova has minimal winter sports infrastructure, making her qualification through FIS small-nation criteria all the more significant. She represents a new generation of Moldovan winter sports athletes.
