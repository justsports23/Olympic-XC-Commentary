## Venue History
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Time Back |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|
| 07 Feb 2026 | Olympics | 20km Skiathlon (Tesero) | 14th | +3:41.0 |

Ilar's 14th-place finish in the Olympic skiathlon at Tesero was below her season form, suggesting the venue or conditions were challenging for her. However, the 10km Free interval start is her preferred event this season. ([Olympics.com - Results](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/ccs/ms/w/skiathln----------/fnl-/000100--/race-result))

## Key Storylines
- **Crystal Globe contender:** Ilar is 2nd in the overall World Cup standings behind Jessie Diggins, with a realistic chance at becoming the first Swedish woman ever to win the overall title. After her Oberhof win, she said: "Of course I am [going for the Crystal Globe]. I would lie if I'd say anything else." ([FIS News](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/ilar-eyes-crystal-globe-after-oberhof-win))
- **10km Freestyle is her Olympic medal target:** Ilar has identified the 10km skate as her best medal opportunity at these Games. She has been on the podium in 10km Free events repeatedly this season (2nd in Trondheim, 2nd in Davos). ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/a-swedish-breakthrough-rising-star-sends-a-clear-olympic-message/))
- **Disappointing skiathlon:** Her 14th place in the skiathlon, 3:41 behind winner Frida Karlsson, was well below her season form. She will be motivated to bounce back in the 10km Free.
- **Late bloomer on the World Cup:** Made her debut in 2019 but didn't win until November 2023 (age 26). Her dramatic improvement over the past two seasons makes her one of the sport's most compelling stories.
- **Name change:** Competed as Moa Olsson at the 2022 Beijing Olympics before marrying and changing her surname to Ilar. ([Wikipedia - Moa Ilar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa_Ilar))
