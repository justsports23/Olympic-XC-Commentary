## Personal Life & Background
- **Hometown:** Oppdal, Norway -- a small mountain community in Trondelag known for its skiing traditions ([Wikipedia - Astrid Oeyre Slind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_%C3%98yre_Slind))
- **Current residence:** Trondheim, near Haukvatnet on Byasen, close to the Bymarka training area. Her proximity to excellent training areas allows her to return home quickly after sessions for recovery. ([The Daily Skier](https://dailyskier.com/2017/11/22/up-close-and-personal-with-astrid-oyre-slind-part-1/))
- **Family -- The Oeyre Slind sisters:** Astrid has a twin sister, Silje Oeyre Slind, and a younger sister, Kari Oeyre Slind (born 22 October 1991). All three sisters have competed as elite cross-country skiers for Oppdal IL, though Astrid is the only one who specialized in long-distance marathon skiing. Astrid and Silje are identical twins -- Astrid has quipped that they "tried trading places at school with some success, but never with our boyfriends, haha." ([Wikipedia - Kari Oeyre Slind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_%C3%98yre_Slind), [Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com/page/Astrid_%C3%98yre_Slind))
- **How she started skiing:** Raised in a skiing family in Oppdal, Slind began competing internationally in her youth. She was a promising junior, winning gold at the 2010 U23 World Championships (15 km Pursuit), but struggled to break through at the senior World Cup level and left the national team setup in 2015 to race marathon skiing. ([Wikipedia - Astrid Oeyre Slind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_%C3%98yre_Slind))
- **Training lifestyle:** Slind travels for over 100 days per year, mostly between Scandinavia and continental Europe. She trains roughly 800 hours per year, primarily on skis and roller skis, supplemented by running in summer. ([FasterSkier - Devon Kershaw Show](https://fasterskier.com/2025/11/the-devon-kershaw-show-astrid-oyre-slinds-long-and-winding-career-arc/))
- **Hobbies:** Backcountry skiing is her primary recreational hobby, distinct from competitive racing. She has expressed a fondness for the Norwegian soda Solo Super and frequently listens to music by Norwegian artist Dagny. ([Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com/page/Astrid_%C3%98yre_Slind))
- **Notable story:** After winning her first World Cup race at age 36 in Davos (December 2024), Slind expressed disbelief: "I can't believe it. I never thought this would happen, especially not while Therese was still racing." Her journey from national team dropout to marathon legend to World Cup winner at 36 is one of the most remarkable comeback stories in cross-country skiing.

**Season summary:** Slind has had a strong 2025/26 season with two World Cup victories (Davos 20 km C, Tour de Ski 10 km C in Toblach) and three additional podiums. Her season was interrupted when she was forced to withdraw from the Tour de Ski while in 2nd place overall due to a sore throat. She returned at Goms with a 3rd place but was disappointing in the Olympic skiathlon, fading from the lead group in the freestyle section to finish 6th.

### Marathon / Ski Classics Career
Slind spent 8 seasons (2015-2022) racing long-distance ski marathons on the Ski Classics (now Visma Ski Classics / World Classic Tour) circuit, where she became one of the most dominant women in the sport:

| Event | Year | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Vasaloppet** (90 km, SWE) | 2022 | **1st** (new women's course record: 3:50:06) |
| **Birkebeinerrennet** (54 km, NOR) | 2024 | **1st** (2:50:44.5, won by 59.6s) |
| **Birkebeinerrennet** (54 km, NOR) | [UNVERIFIED year] | **1st** (two-time winner) |

- 2013 Winter Universiade: Gold (5 km), Bronze (15 km) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_%C3%98yre_Slind)

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Elite. Her marathon background is built on classic technique and she is arguably the strongest female classic skier in the world right now. Won the 2022 Vasaloppet (90 km classic) in record time. Won 20 km classic races at Davos in consecutive years. Was first woman to win Birkebeinerrennet without kick wax. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/long-distance/birkebeinerrennet-womens-results-solo-win-for-astrid-oyre-slind/), [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/oyre-slind-wins-20km-interval-start-at-the-davos-world-cup/)
- **Freestyle strength:** Improving but clearly weaker than classic. In the Olympic skiathlon, she was among the leaders through the classic half but faded significantly in the freestyle section, dropping from the lead group to 6th. Her FIS sprint ranking (105th) and mixed freestyle results confirm this. However, she did win the Toblach 20 km F interval start (Dec 31, 2024) and the Engadin 20 km F mass start (Jan 2025), so she is not weak in freestyle — she just cannot match the very best when it comes to pure skating speed. [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-imperial-frida-karlsson-triumphs-in-the-skiathlon-leonie-perry-16th-0207/), [FIS News](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/success-for-slind-as-veteran-ends-2024-with-first-freestyle-win)
- **Sprint ability:** Minimal. Ranked 105th in sprint standings (2 pts). Qualified 27th in Tour de Ski sprint, finished 29th. Not a factor in sprint events.
- **Distance preference:** Longer is better. Her marathon background (54-90 km races) means she excels when the distance stretches. 10 km may be somewhat short for her, though she won the Tour de Ski 10 km classic stage.
- **Best format:** Interval start classic races. Her four World Cup wins have come in interval start format. Her pacing ability and endurance make her ideal for time-trial-style races.
- **Climbing ability:** Outstanding. Marathon skiing (Vasaloppet, Birkebeinerrennet) demands tremendous climbing ability, and her dominance in those events speaks volumes. Her double-poling power is exceptional. [Fischer Sports](https://www.fischersports.com/athlete/astrid-oeyre-slind)

**Assessment for 10 km Interval Start Free:** This is a mixed picture for Slind. The interval start format is her strength, but the freestyle technique is not her best discipline. At 10 km, the distance is shorter than her ideal range. Her Olympic skiathlon result showed she can lose time in freestyle sections. However, she has proven she can win freestyle races (Toblach 20 km F, Engadin 20 km F), so she should not be dismissed.

**Venue assessment:** Slind has good results at this venue from the 2024/25 Tour de Ski (2nd and 3rd in mass start events). However, she did not complete the 2025/26 Tour de Ski Val di Fiemme stages due to illness withdrawal, and her Olympic skiathlon here saw her fade in the freestyle portion. Her Val di Fiemme record is positive but comes with the caveat that her best results were in classic or combined events, not pure freestyle.

## Key Storylines

### Late Blooming Legend
Slind's career arc is one of the most remarkable in cross-country skiing history. After a frustrating early World Cup career where she couldn't crack the top 20, she left the national team in 2015 to race marathon skiing. She became a marathon legend — winning Vasaloppet, Birkebeinerrennet (twice), La Diagonela (twice), and entering the Ski Classics Hall of Fame. When Norwegian legends Bjorgen and Johaug retired, she returned to the World Cup in 2022/23 and won her first World Cup race at age 36 in December 2024 — over 16 years after her debut. "I can't believe it. I never thought this would happen, especially not while Therese was still racing," she said after her Davos victory. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/slind-living-her-dream/), [FIS News](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/slind-beats-niskanen-and-johaug-to-claim-first-world-cup-win-in-davos-20km)

### First Olympic Games at 37
The Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics mark Slind's first-ever Olympic Winter Games appearance. She was never selected during her earlier career, and her marathon years kept her outside the Olympic team structure. Making the team and competing at age 37 is a remarkable achievement in itself. [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42289)

### Independent Training Setup
Slind has repeatedly declined to join the Norwegian national team's training group, preferring to train independently with Team Aker Daehlie and her training partner Chris Andre Jespersen. This unconventional approach has drawn attention but clearly works for her. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/astrid-oyre-slind-snubs-the-national-team-once-again/)

### Skiathlon Heartbreak
In the Olympic skiathlon (Feb 7), Slind was among the three leaders at the ski change along with Karlsson and Andersson, but she couldn't sustain her position in the freestyle section and was caught by Heidi Weng (bronze) and others, finishing 6th. The freestyle fade is a recurring theme that could affect her in this 10 km Free race. [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-imperial-frida-karlsson-triumphs-in-the-skiathlon-leonie-perry-16th-0207/)

### Tour de Ski Withdrawal
Slind was in 2nd place overall in the Tour de Ski when she was forced to withdraw on January 1, 2026, due to a sore throat that developed overnight. This may have been a blessing in disguise, allowing her body to recover for the Olympics, but it does raise questions about her health status. [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-tour-de-ski-astrid-oeyre-slind-second-in-the-rankings-retires-0101/)

### Family of Skiers
Slind is a twin sister of Silje Oeyre Slind and older sister of Kari Oeyre Slind — all three are/were competitive cross-country skiers. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_%C3%98yre_Slind)

### Equipment Change
Slind switched from Madshus skis to Fischer ahead of recent seasons, citing Fischer's ability to handle changing conditions better. In marathon skiing, where athletes race through varying conditions over long distances, this was a critical factor.
