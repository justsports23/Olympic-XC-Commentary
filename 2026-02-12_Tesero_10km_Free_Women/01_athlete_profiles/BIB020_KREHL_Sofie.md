## Key Storylines
- **Second Olympics:** This is Krehl's second Olympic Games after winning a surprise silver medal in the relay at Beijing 2022. The German relay team was underestimated, but Krehl anchored the final leg, holding off Sweden and Finland to secure silver behind Russia. [Olympics.com](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/cross-country-skiing/athlete-profile-n1012747-sofie-krehl.htm)
- **Olympic sprint 2 days ago (Feb 10):** Qualified 22nd in the classic sprint but was eliminated last (6th) in her QF heat. The sprint effort 2 days before this 10km free adds to cumulative fatigue, though the QF was a short effort. — [Sportschau](https://www.sportschau.de/olympia/langlauf-rydzek-und-gimmler-verpassen-sprint-finale,langlauf-sprint-klassisch-100.html)
- **Sprint-to-distance crossover:** While primarily a sprint specialist (21st in World Cup sprint standings), Krehl is racing the 10 km free at the Olympics. Her 23rd at Ruka in a distance event and 30th at Trondheim in 10 km free show she can compete at this level. — [FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=165714&type=result)
- **Veteran experience:** At 30, Krehl brings significant championship experience including two Olympics, multiple World Championships (including the 2021 home Worlds in Oberstdorf), and years of World Cup competition.
- **German team depth:** Third German woman behind Victoria Carl and Katharina Hennig, providing depth for the German program. — [sofiekrehl.de](https://sofiekrehl.de/en/startseite-de/)
- **Relay relay relay:** Her Olympic relay silver in Beijing, where she held off the field on the final leg, was described as *"exceeding all childhood dreams"* and remains a defining career moment. — [sofiekrehl.de](https://sofiekrehl.de/en/startseite-de/)
