## Personal Life & Background

- **Hometown/birthplace:** Born on 3 October 2001 in **Tallinn**, Estonia. Grew up in **Aravete**, a small town in Jarva County in central Estonia. She currently lives in Tartu with her twin sister Keidy. ([Skispirit Team](https://skispirit.ee/en/meist/); [Olympics Wiki](https://olympics.fandom.com/wiki/Kaidy_Kaasiku))
- **Family:** Kaidy is one of three siblings who all pursued cross-country skiing. She has a twin sister, **Keidy Kaasiku** (FIS Code 209655), who is also competing at these Olympics for Estonia, and an older brother, **Jarmo Kaasiku** (born 7 May 1999), who competed internationally for Estonia at junior level. Their father introduced them to sports at age 5, and they began cross-country skiing in the first grade, following the example of their older brother. Their grandparents live near Aravete in the countryside, and the twins have spoken about how visiting them between training camps provides fresh energy and renewal. The twins share an Instagram account (@kaasiku.twins), describing themselves as "Twin Cross Country skiers from Estonia." ([Skispirit Team](https://skispirit.ee/en/meist/); [the-sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/jarmo-kaasiku-cross-country-skiing-spf576122.html); [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kaasiku.twins/))
- **How they started skiing:** Under their father's guidance and following older brother Jarmo, the twins started ski training in first grade with coach Raido Rohi. Growing up, they tried swimming, orienteering, and athletics, but cross-country skiing fascinated them the most. They have been in the sport for over 15 years. Their current coach, **Jaanus Teppan**, has worked with them since spring 2018, when the non-profit Skispirit organization was founded. ([Skispirit Team](https://skispirit.ee/en/meist/))
- **Education:** Kaidy attended **Aravete High School** (Pohja-Jarva School), where she and Keidy got their driver's licenses. She is currently studying **physical education** at the **University of Tartu**.

- **Hobbies/interests:** Apart from skiing, Kaidy has personal bests in track and field events -- a 3000m time of 10:48.25 and a 1500m time of 5:00.80, both from July 2020 in Rakvere. The twins describe themselves as very family-oriented and rarely miss a chance to visit home.

- **Quotes:** Direct English-language quotes from Kaidy specifically are limited. The FISU article about the twins captures their shared approach to training and competing. [DATA NOT FOUND for individual quotes]
- **Personality/reputation:** Kaidy is the slightly stronger of the Kaasiku twins in terms of FIS distance points (56.15 vs. Keidy's 64.87) and has achieved the better individual World Championship result (19th in 10km classic at Trondheim 2025). The twins' story -- from small-town Aravete to two-time Olympians studying together, living together, and racing against each other -- is one of the most unique in cross-country skiing. They are helping to elevate Estonia's profile in the sport.
