## Personal Life & Background
- **Hometown:** Born and raised in Tehran, Iran ([The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/))
- **Current residence:** Marbella, Spain — where she earns her living as a personal trainer and teaches roller-skiing in southern Spain ([The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/))
- **Education:** Holds a university degree in architecture ([The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/))
- **Family:** Grew up in a sports-oriented household in Tehran. Her father was a member of Iran's national karate team and her mother was an aerobics instructor — both significantly influenced her early love for sports ([The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/))
- **From swimming to skiing:** Dreamed of the Olympics since childhood, but that goal was impossible in her first sport — swimming — because Iran does not select female swimmers for the Games due to the sport's revealing swimwear conflicting with Islamic dress codes. She was among Iran's top butterfly swimmers before switching to cross-country skiing, which offered a path to the Olympic stage while allowing her to compete fully covered ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaneh_Beyrami_Baher); [The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/))
- **How she discovered skiing:** Her true love for winter sports blossomed during a family ski trip as a teenager, during which she was awestruck by local skiers who zipped down the steep slopes with incredible skill ([The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/))
- **Training challenges in Tehran:** It takes about 90 minutes to reach the nearest ski area, with air pollution and chaotic traffic hindering dryland training in the city. She would sometimes spend two hours in heavy traffic just to reach her training tracks. She balanced her commitments as an architect with athletics, fitting in training sessions early in the morning and late at night ([The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/); [Xinhua](http://english.news.cn/20250209/3baeb59c7b1b420cb716e43392404249/c.html))
- **Social media constraints:** She must be very careful about her public image — even harmless photos can have consequences if they do not conform to Iran's strict Islamic dress codes. The Iranian Ski Federation monitors her social media and is pleased when she appears with her hair tied and in modest clothing ([The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/))
- **Equipment challenges:** At one competition in Kuusamo, Finland, she arrived with just one classic and one skate ski pair — far fewer than the multiple pairs elite athletes typically carry ([The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/))
- **Mentoring role:** Has transitioned into mentoring young athletes, including coaching Iran's team at the 2024 Winter Youth Olympic Games in Gangwon. She emphasizes that *"discipline is crucial, it's a red line"* ([The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/))
- **Flag bearer — twice:** Carried Iran's flag at the PyeongChang 2018 Opening Ceremony and again at the Milano Cortina 2026 Opening Ceremony — a rare honor ([Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/523479/Iran-s-flag-bearers-announced-for-2026-Winter-Olympics); [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaneh_Beyrami_Baher))
- **Missing Beijing 2022:** Missing qualification for Beijing 2022 was *"a huge regret"* — she competed at every world-level championship since 2015 except those Games ([China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202502/11/WS67aab981a310a2ab06eab796.html))
- **On women's empowerment:** Has spoken about what Iranian women can achieve in sport despite the constraints they face, serving as an inspiration for female athletes in restrictive societies ([Big News Network](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/278046807/iranian-women-achieve-great-samaneh-baher))

## Key Storylines
Beyrami Baher's story is among the most powerful in the entire Olympic field. A 34-year-old architect from Tehran, she was originally one of Iran's top butterfly swimmers but was forced to abandon her Olympic swimming dream because Iran does not select female swimmers for the Games due to the sport's revealing swimwear conflicting with Islamic dress codes. She switched to cross-country skiing — a sport where she could compete fully covered — as her pathway to the Olympics. She carried Iran's flag at both PyeongChang 2018 and Milano Cortina 2026 Opening Ceremonies. She trains in Tehran under extreme constraints: 90-minute drives to the nearest ski area, air pollution and chaotic traffic hindering dryland training, and constant monitoring of her social media by the Iranian Ski Federation to ensure compliance with strict dress codes. She balances her athletic career with her work as an architect. At 454.93 FIS points, she has the highest point total in this field, but her presence at the Olympics transcends results — she represents the struggle of female athletes in restrictive societies to compete on the world stage.
