## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Origins
Leonie Perry was born on November 4, 2004, in **La Bresse**, a small town in the **Vosges** mountains of eastern France ([FIS Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=240145)). La Bresse is a traditional Nordic skiing community, and Perry is a proud product of its trails and culture. She has described her childhood on the Vosges slopes simply: *"I was a little girl from the Vosges who skied mainly for fun, with friends."* ([France Bleu](https://www.francebleu.fr/emissions/l-esprit-sportif/ski-de-fond-le-jeu-devenu-projet-le-projet-devenu-destin-pour-leonie-perry-2208169))

### How She Started Skiing
Perry's path began as play and evolved into purpose: *"The game became a project, and the project became a real ambition."* ([France Bleu](https://www.francebleu.fr/emissions/l-esprit-sportif/ski-de-fond-le-jeu-devenu-projet-le-projet-devenu-destin-pour-leonie-perry-2208169)) She is a member of **Ski Club La Bressaude**, the same club that produced her idol **Delphine Claudel**, the first French woman to win a World Cup cross-country race (Val di Fiemme, January 2023). Perry has spoken glowingly of Claudel: *"I'm a huge fan of hers, so I'm really excited! She's always been my great idol."* ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-davos-leonie-perry-magnificent-sixth-in-the-individual-skate-first-world-cup-victory-for-karoline-simpson-larsen-1214/))

### Family
Perry's parents are supportive and attend her competitions. After sitting in the provisional leader's seat at Davos in December 2025, she mentioned wanting *"to take advantage of the moment... to say hello to the parents"* ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-davos-leonie-perry-magnificent-sixth-in-the-individual-skate-first-world-cup-victory-for-karoline-simpson-larsen-1214/)). During the Olympic skiathlon on February 7, 2026, approximately 50 fans gathered in La Bresse in front of a big screen to cheer on Perry and Claudel ([France Bleu](https://www.francebleu.fr/emissions/l-info-d-ici-ici-lorraine-meurthe-et-moselle-et-vosges/jo-d-hiver-2026-les-fans-reunis-a-la-bresse-pour-soutenir-les-fondeuses-vosgiennes-16eme-et-31eme-du-skiathlon-3716777)).

### Friendship with Amandine Mengin
Perry has a close friendship with biathlete **Amandine Mengin**, also 21, who grew up at the same club. Mengin told Nordic Magazine: *"We grew up together... We were in the club together when we were kids and we competed in La Bresse at the same time."* ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/biathlon-im-her-biggest-fan-i-love-her-to-bits-amandine-mengin-and-leonie-perry-two-friends-on-the-world-cup-at-the-same-time-1205/)) The two friends are on the World Cup circuit at the same time in different disciplines -- a source of mutual support.

### Personality
Perry is known for her humor and positive attitude. After a difficult ski change during the Olympic skiathlon, she smiled and said: *"It was my first skiathlon race, so you have to start somewhere."* ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-it-really-gives-me-confidence-for-the-10-km-skate-sixteenth-in-the-skiathlon-leonie-perry-looks-back-on-her-race-for-nordic-magazine-0207/)) After her career-best 6th at Davos, she was almost in disbelief: *"I can't believe it, I tell myself I must have dreamed it."* ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-leonie-perry-talks-to-nordic-magazine-about-her-unreal-sixth-place-in-the-davos-individual-skate-race-i-cant-believe-it-i-tell-myself-i-must-have-dreamed-it-1216/))

### Fractured Thumb Recovery
In mid-October 2025, Perry fractured her right thumb, disrupting pre-season preparation. She had a custom brace made in Albertville and returned to training immediately, even skiing with one pole ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-less-than-two-months-after-fracturing-her-right-thumb-leonie-perry-is-selected-for-the-trondheim-world-cup-it-bodes-well-for-the-future-1202/)).

## Career Highlights
- **Olympic Games:** Milano Cortina 2026 is her first Olympic Games. Finished **16th in the skiathlon** (57:40.4, +3:55.2) on Feb 7 — the best result among French women in that race. She was 26th at the ski change but climbed to 16th during the freestyle leg ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-imperial-frida-karlsson-triumphs-in-the-skiathlon-leonie-perry-16th-0207/)).
- **World Cup Career Best:** **6th in the 10km Freestyle Interval Start at Davos** (Dec 14, 2025), just 15.9 seconds behind winner Karoline Simpson-Larsen. She was 2nd at the first intermediate split and 4th at the halfway mark. This made her only the fifth French woman ever to finish top-6 in a World Cup 10km, joining Sophie Villeneuve, Karine Laurent Philippot, Delphine Claudel, and Flora Dolci ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-davos-leonie-perry-magnificent-sixth-in-the-individual-skate-first-world-cup-victory-for-karoline-simpson-larsen-1214/)).
- **Tour de Ski:** 27th overall in the 2025-26 Tour de Ski (2:19:36.9, +8:10.8). Nearly reached the podium in the mass-start skate heat at Toblach, finishing 4th and missing out by less than one second ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-toblach-leonie-perry-less-than-a-second-from-the-podium-the-heat-mass-start-skate-for-jessie-diggins-1231/)).
- **U23 World Championships (Schilpario, Italy, Feb 2025):** 4th in Mixed Relay 4x5km (+52.0s, just off the podium with teammates Victor Cullet Calderini, Cloe Pagnier, and Mathieu Blanc); top-10 in 10km Freestyle Individual; competed in 20km Classic Mass Start ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-schilpario-world-championships-victor-cullet-calderini-cloe-pagnier-mathieu-blanc-and-leonie-perry-just-off-the-podium-in-the-u23-mixed-relay-0209/), [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-schilpario-individual-u23-skate-and-world-gold-for-helen-hoffmann-cloe-pagnier-and-leonie-perry-in-the-top-10-0208/)).
- **Junior World Championships (2023-24):** 23rd in 10km Women's Individual [UNVERIFIED — based on search summary] ([FIS Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=240145)).
- **French National Titles:** French Senior and U23 Champion in 20km Classic Mass Start on rollerskis at Autrans (Oct 2025) ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/rollerski-autrans-norways-magni-smedaas-wins-the-mass-start-classic-leonie-perry-crowned-french-champion-ahead-of-hanna-fine-1005/)). Won the sprint skate qualifier at the French Cup in Bessans (Nov 2025) ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-bessans-french-cup-leonie-perry-wins-the-sprint-skate-qualifier-1127/)).
- **World Cup Podiums/Wins:** 0 (career-best: 6th at Davos)

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Developing — finished 17th in the 20km classic mass start at Goms (Jan 2026, +2:01.9). Was 26th at the ski change in the Olympic skiathlon (classic portion) before rallying in freestyle. Classic is clearly her weaker technique relative to skating.
- **Freestyle strength:** Strong — this is her primary technique. Career-best 6th at Davos came in 10km freestyle. The 10km free interval start is her ideal event format. She climbed from 26th to 16th in the freestyle portion of the Olympic skiathlon, demonstrating how much stronger she is in skating.
- **Sprint ability:** Moderate — FIS Sprint points 103.32. Nearly made the podium in a Tour de Ski mass-start skate heat at Toblach (4th by 0.6 seconds). Has speed but not a pure sprinter.
- **Distance preference:** 10km-20km. At 21 years old, she is most effective at middle distances. Has not yet shown the endurance base for ultra-distance events.
- **Best format:** Interval start (6th at Davos in 10km F interval) — this is exactly the format of the upcoming 10km race.
- **Climbing ability:** [UNVERIFIED] — Her struggles on the Tour de Ski final stage at Val di Fiemme (21st, +2:34.6) may suggest climbing is not yet a strength, though she is still very young and developing.

## Venue History
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Time Back |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2026-01-04 | Tour de Ski Finale | 10km F Mass Start, Val di Fiemme | 21st | +2:34.6 |
| 2026-02-07 | Olympic Games | Skiathlon 10/10km C/F, Tesero | **16th** | +3:55.2 |

Perry has raced at the Tesero / Val di Fiemme venue twice this season: once during the Tour de Ski finale and once in the Olympic skiathlon five days ago. Her 16th-place Olympic skiathlon result is a much more relevant indicator than the TdS stage, which came at the end of a grueling multi-day tour. ([FIS Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=240145), [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/ccs/ms/w/skiathln----------/fnl-/000100--/race-result))

## Key Storylines
- **Olympic Debut at 21:** Perry is one of the youngest competitors in the field. Her 16th-place skiathlon result was an impressive Olympic debut and she has spoken about how it gives her confidence for the 10km freestyle, saying: *"It really gives me confidence for the 10 km skate"* ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-it-really-gives-me-confidence-for-the-10-km-skate-sixteenth-in-the-skiathlon-leonie-perry-looks-back-on-her-race-for-nordic-magazine-0207/)).
- **Breakout Season:** This has been a transformative year for Perry. From a career-best 21st at Les Rousses last season, she exploded to 6th at Davos in December 2025 — the best result by a French woman in a World Cup 10km in years. Her FIS distance points improved from 59.87 to 34.44 during this season alone ([FIS Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=240145)).
- **Following in Delphine Claudel's Footsteps:** Perry grew up in La Bresse alongside her idol Delphine Claudel, the first French woman to win a World Cup XC race (Val di Fiemme, Jan 2023). Perry has said of Claudel: *"She's always been my great idol"* ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-davos-leonie-perry-magnificent-sixth-in-the-individual-skate-first-world-cup-victory-for-karoline-simpson-larsen-1214/)).
- **Fractured Thumb Recovery:** Perry fractured her right thumb in mid-October 2025, disrupting pre-season preparation. She had a custom brace made in Albertville and returned to training immediately, even skiing with one pole. Despite being selected for the Trondheim World Cup, she had to withdraw due to illness. She rebounded spectacularly with her 6th at Davos shortly after ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-less-than-two-months-after-fracturing-her-right-thumb-leonie-perry-is-selected-for-the-trondheim-world-cup-it-bodes-well-for-the-future-1202/)).
- **10km Freestyle Interval Start = Her Best Event:** The upcoming race is precisely the format and technique where Perry has achieved her career best (6th at Davos). She will be highly motivated to match or improve on that result on the Olympic stage.
- **French Team's Best Hope in Distance:** Perry posted the best result among French women in the Olympic skiathlon (16th). She carries the hopes of French distance skiing in this event.
