## Personal Life & Background
Magdalena Scherz was born on December 20, 2001, in Vienna (Wien), Austria ([Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131915516)). She represents Lower Austria (Niederösterreich) within the Austrian Ski Federation (ÖSV) system ([Ski Austria](https://www.skiaustria.at/de/teams/magdalena-scherz)). She holds A-Team status within the Austrian cross-country skiing program for the 2025/26 season, alongside national team leader Teresa Stadlober and Mika Vermeulen ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/austrian-cross-country-ski-teams-for-season-2025-2026/)).

Scherz was named to Austria's five-woman cross-country skiing team for the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics, alongside Lisa Achleitner, Katharina Brudermann, Heidi Bucher, and Teresa Stadlober ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/austrian-cross-country-skiing-team-confirmed-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)). The Austrian Olympic Committee nominated 115 athletes total for the Games -- the largest Austrian delegation since Sochi 2014 ([VOL.AT](https://www.vol.at/this-is-austrias-squad-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/9947810)). Austria is a nation traditionally stronger in alpine skiing and Nordic combined than in cross-country sprint, making Scherz's development in the discipline noteworthy.
