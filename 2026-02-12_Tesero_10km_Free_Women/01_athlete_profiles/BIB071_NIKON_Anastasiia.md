- **Competing during wartime:** Nikon is the most experienced of Ukraine's three women racing the 10km free, having competed on the World Cup circuit throughout 2025-26. Like all Ukrainian winter sport athletes, she competes under extraordinary circumstances -- Ukrainian skier Ivan Kovbasnyuk has described the psychological toll: "It's really hard psychologically for me to race here because a lot of my friends are fighting. A lot of my friends were already killed in this war." Ukrainian athletes have a special exemption from military conscription to allow them to continue competing internationally.
