## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Upbringing
Hailey Swirbul was born on 10 July 1998 in Grand Junction, Colorado. At kindergarten age, her family moved to El Jebel, a small community in the panoramic Roaring Fork Valley near Aspen, Colorado. She grew up *"in just a really active family,"* noting that her parents valued getting outside and doing things together -- though neither parent was an elite athlete.

### Family
Her older brother, Keegan Swirbul, is a professional road cyclist with the Rally Cycling team, known as "Flying Swirbul" in the climbing community. It was Keegan who convinced his younger sister to try cross-country skiing as a winter cross-training discipline for cycling. At roughly 10 years old, Swirbul finished on the podium in her first cross-country race and realized she had found her calling. Growing up in El Jebel, she initially focused on mountain biking and mogul skiing before Nordic skiing took over.

### Education
Swirbul developed her skills with the Aspen Valley Ski & Snowboard Club before attending the University of Alaska Anchorage, where she earned a civil engineering degree while competing as an NCAA skier. She was named to the 2018 Google Cloud Academic All-America Division II Women's At-Large First Team -- one of the nation's top 15 student-athletes combining athletic and academic excellence -- with a perfect 4.00 GPA as a civil engineering major.

### Retirement and "The Other Life" (2023-2025)
After retiring from competitive skiing in March 2023 at just 24 years old due to burnout, Swirbul embarked on an adventure-filled two years away from the sport. She sold most of her equipment, worked at an engineering firm, and served as a ski patroller at Aspen Highlands -- describing the hike-to terrain at 12,000 feet with *"an 800-vertical-foot hike"* and hiking *"up and down that bowl for six hours a day."* She also earned her pilot's license, kayaked the Grand Canyon, and explored the outdoors on her own terms. At the time of her retirement, she said: *"I set out to find peace with skiing this season after a difficult few years between Covid and the Olympic cycle."* ([Aspen Daily News](https://www.aspendailynews.com/news/from-the-olympics-to-highlands-ski-patrol-and-back/article_932aca67-3f81-4d9c-903c-5438cac66f0e.html)) ([US Ski and Snowboard](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/olympian-swirbul-announces-retirement-world-cup-cross-country-skiing))

### The Comeback
Swirbul's return to competitive skiing was sparked in 2025 when she joined Alaska Pacific University (APU) as a coach for the junior program and later the elite team. Training alongside America's best skiers reignited her competitive fire. Fellow 2022 Olympians Novie McCabe and Luke Jager somewhat jokingly asked if she was thinking of *"pulling a Michael Jordan."* Swirbul laughed it off, but the seed had been planted -- and it was watered by Oliver Burkeman's book, *Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals*. She returned with *"a completely renewed perspective"* and promptly dominated domestic racing, winning US Nationals by 30 seconds.

### Hobbies & Interests
Beyond skiing, Swirbul is passionate about baking, oil painting, fly fishing, and studying. She advocates for gender equality in coaching through her work with the Women Ski Coaches Association, addressing the wage gap and ensuring equal consideration for coaching positions.

No prior results at Tesero. This is her first competition in the Italian Dolomites region at this level.

## Key Storylines
Swirbul's comeback narrative is among the most compelling at these Olympics. After retiring in 2023 — burned out at age 24 despite a World Cup podium, an Olympic appearance, and two Junior World medals — she spent two years getting her pilot's license, working as a civil engineer, kayaking the Grand Canyon, and patrolling at Aspen Highlands. She returned in fall 2025 with "a completely renewed perspective" and promptly dominated domestic racing, winning US Nationals by 30 seconds. Her World Cup return showed she can still compete (22nd in Oberhof sprint, 24th in Goms 20km classic). At 27, she is seeking a "redo" of her Olympic experience after an honest but difficult time at Beijing 2022, where she selflessly gave up one of her individual starts so teammate Rosie Brennan could compete.
