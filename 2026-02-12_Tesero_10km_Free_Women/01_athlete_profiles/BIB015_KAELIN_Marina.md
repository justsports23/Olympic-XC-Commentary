## Personal Life & Background
- **Hometown/Birthplace:** Born on July 28, 2003. From St. Moritz in the Upper Engadine region of southeastern Switzerland. Nobody knows the trails around Silvaplana better than the Kaelin sisters. [blue News](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/a-real-home-world-cup-for-sisters-marina-and-nadja-kaelin-2532947.html)
- **Family:** Her older sister Nadja Kaelin (born April 20, 2001, in St. Moritz) is also a Swiss cross-country skier who finished 4th in the Olympic skiathlon at Milano Cortina 2026. The sisters have an exceptionally close bond and train together in Davos under coach Karoline Braaten Guidon. They share a room at their hotel near Tesero during the Olympics. Marina has said: *"Of course it's nice to have someone with you who you know well and can talk to."* She has also noted that having her sister alongside was *"always a motivation to want to be better."* [blue News](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/a-real-home-world-cup-for-sisters-marina-and-nadja-kaelin-2532947.html), [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-switzerland-dazzled-by-nadja-kaelins-fourth-place-in-the-skiathlon-0207/)
- **How she started skiing:** Grew up in the snow-rich Upper Engadine and was immersed in cross-country skiing from an early age. Competed at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games. A few years ago, the sisters moved their training base from the Upper Engadine to Davos for better snow-farming facilities and access to other national squad athletes, though Marina has noted that *"the altitude is even better in the Engadin than in Davos, and I like the cross-country trails there better."* [blue News](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/a-real-home-world-cup-for-sisters-marina-and-nadja-kaelin-2532947.html), [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=249166)

- **Quotes:** On the Engadin home World Cup course: *"Nobody knows this course as well as we do, we know practically every kilometer."* [blue News](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/a-real-home-world-cup-for-sisters-marina-and-nadja-kaelin-2532947.html)
- **Notable personal stories:** Nadja felt pressure during the Olympic selection period -- not primarily for herself, but for her younger sister Marina. Once Marina also secured her Olympic spot, Nadja was back on track. The sisters hugged after finishing seventh together in the Engadin Mixed Relay. At the Olympics, Nadja finished 4th in the skiathlon (just 25 seconds from a medal -- the closest a Swiss cross-country skier has come to an individual Olympic medal), while Marina finished 19th.

## Key Storylines
- **Olympic debut at 22:** Kaelin is making her first Olympic appearance alongside her older sister [Nadja Kaelin](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-switzerland-dazzled-by-nadja-kaelins-fourth-place-in-the-skiathlon-0207/), who finished a remarkable 4th in the skiathlon. The Swiss sisters are emerging as a formidable tandem.
- **U23 dominance:** Her gold medal at the [2024 Planica U23 World Championships](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/swiss-marina-kalin-wins-the-u23-world-championships-mass-start-in-planica/) in the 20km freestyle mass start -- the same discipline as today's race -- makes her a notable athlete to watch in the 10km free.
- **Rapid progression to World Cup level:** From top FIS/Continental Cup results to Tour de Ski top-20 finishes in the same season, Kaelin's trajectory is steeply upward.
- **Sister dynamic:** Marina and Nadja Kaelin [train together in Davos](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/a-real-home-world-cup-for-sisters-marina-and-nadja-kaelin-2532947.html) under coach Karoline Braaten Guidon, and both competed at the home World Cup in Engadin where ["nobody knows this course as well as we do"](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/a-real-home-world-cup-for-sisters-marina-and-nadja-kaelin-2532947.html).
- **U23 World Cup leader:** Led the [Women's U23 World Cup standings after the Ruka season opener](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/cross-country-world-cup-2025-2026-standings-after-the-ruka-premiere/) with 37 points.
- **Freestyle specialist racing 10km free:** Today's race is an ideal format for Kaelin given her U23 World Championship gold was won in freestyle technique.
