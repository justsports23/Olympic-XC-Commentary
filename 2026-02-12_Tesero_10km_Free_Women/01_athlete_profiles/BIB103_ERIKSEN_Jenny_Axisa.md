## Personal Life & Background
Jenny Axisa Eriksen was born on **4 April 2005 in Norway** to a **Norwegian father and a Maltese mother** ([Maltese Olympic Committee](https://nocmalta.org/malta-to-be-represented-by-cross-country-skier-jenny-axisa-eriksen-at-milano-cortina-2026-winter-olympic-games/)). Raised in Norway where snow is abundant, she **began skiing at the age of two**, developing her skills through local training before committing to international competition under the Maltese flag ([Malta Daily](https://maltadaily.mt/sports/jenny-axisa-eriksen-set-to-make-history-for-malta-at-milano-cortina-2026)). She has expressed pride in her **dual Norwegian-Maltese heritage** and the opportunity to inspire young athletes in Malta, a Mediterranean island nation with no snow and no winter sports infrastructure ([Maltese Olympic Committee](https://nocmalta.org/malta-to-be-represented-by-cross-country-skier-jenny-axisa-eriksen-at-milano-cortina-2026-winter-olympic-games/)). Eriksen initially trained with the **Andebu IL** club in Norway, focusing on endurance and technique in alpine environments ([Malta at the 2026 Winter Olympics — Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com/page/malta_at_the_2026_winter_olympics)). More recently, she has been based in **Lillehammer**, training with **Team Hedmark Sjusjoen** under the guidance of coach **Henrik Pedersen** ([Maltese Olympic Committee](https://nocmalta.org/malta-to-be-represented-by-cross-country-skier-jenny-axisa-eriksen-at-milano-cortina-2026-winter-olympic-games/)). Her competition season has included the Norwegian Season Opening, the Norwegian Cup, the Scandinavian Cup in Ostersund, Sweden, and the German Cup — all as part of her first year competing as a senior athlete ([Maltese Olympic Committee](https://nocmalta.org/malta-to-be-represented-by-cross-country-skier-jenny-axisa-eriksen-at-milano-cortina-2026-winter-olympic-games/)). Her achievement in securing Malta's first quota place in cross-country skiing at the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim has been noted for its potential to motivate young athletes to pursue winter sports despite geographical challenges ([Malta Daily](https://maltadaily.mt/sports/jenny-axisa-eriksen-set-to-make-history-for-malta-at-milano-cortina-2026)). She is only the fourth Maltese Winter Olympian ever, following Elise Pellegrin (Alpine, Sochi 2014 / PyeongChang 2018) and Jenise Spiteri (Snowboard, Beijing 2022) ([Malta at the 2026 Winter Olympics — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics)).

## Key Storylines
Eriksen is a history-maker: Malta's first-ever Olympic cross-country skier. Born to a Norwegian father and Maltese mother, she was raised in Norway and developed her skiing in Lillehammer with Team Hedmark Sjusjoen. Her 27th-place finish at the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim in the 10km classical was the performance that secured Malta's Olympic quota — a stunning result for a nation of Mediterranean sunshine and no snow. She is the fourth Maltese Winter Olympian ever, following Elise Pellegrin (Alpine, Sochi 2014/PyeongChang 2018) and Jenise Spiteri (Snowboard, Beijing 2022). At 19, she is one of the youngest athletes in this field and potentially the strongest performer among the lower bibs.
