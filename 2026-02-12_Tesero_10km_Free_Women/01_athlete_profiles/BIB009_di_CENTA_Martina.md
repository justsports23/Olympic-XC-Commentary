She resides in **Paluzza**, a small mountain town also in the Province of Udine, in the Carnic Alps. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Di_Centa); [il Nord Est](https://www.ilnordest.it/dossier/olimpiadi-milano-cortina-2026/di-centa-martina-skiathlon-intervista-olimpiadi-awegwdni))
- **Family:** Martina is the daughter of **Giorgio Di Centa** (born 1972, Tolmezzo) -- a five-time Olympian (1998-2014) and three-time Olympic medallist, including gold in the individual 50km freestyle at the 2006 Torino Olympics in the closest 50km finish in Olympic history (0.8 seconds). Her aunt is **Manuela Di Centa** -- a seven-time Olympic medallist (two gold, two silver, three bronze) across three Winter Olympics (1992-98) and twice World Cup overall champion (1994, 1996). Martina's mother is **Rita Flora**. She has two sisters, **Laura** (a doctor in Udine who taught Martina how to crochet) and **Gaia**, and a brother named **William**, who is described as a promising up-and-comer in cross-country skiing. Her father's brother-in-law is **Fabio Meraldi**. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Di_Centa); [Wikipedia - Giorgio Di Centa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Di_Centa); [Wikipedia - Manuela Di Centa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuela_Di_Centa))
- **How she started skiing:** Martina grew up in a family where skiing was a way of life. Her father Giorgio recalled doing a lot of hiking with his older sisters as a child and making his first steps on skis in the backyard. Martina has spoken about her late grandfather **Gaetano Di Centa**, crediting him with getting her started in skiing. The 2026 Olympics will be her first without her grandfather present. ([Wikipedia - Giorgio Di Centa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Di_Centa); [il Nord Est](https://www.ilnordest.it/dossier/olimpiadi-milano-cortina-2026/di-centa-martina-skiathlon-intervista-olimpiadi-awegwdni))
- **Education:** Completed a linguistic high school education (liceo linguistico) in Tolmezzo, earning her diploma. ([il Nord Est](https://www.ilnordest.it/dossier/olimpiadi-milano-cortina-2026/di-centa-martina-skiathlon-intervista-olimpiadi-awegwdni))
- **Hobbies/interests:** Enjoys spending time with her family when not travelling for competitions. She also enjoys **crocheting** -- a skill she learned from her older sister Laura. ([il Nord Est](https://www.ilnordest.it/dossier/olimpiadi-milano-cortina-2026/di-centa-martina-skiathlon-intervista-olimpiadi-awegwdni))
- **Quotes:**
  - She has expressed the goal of simply enjoying these home Olympics, especially on a course at Tesero that she has known since her youth competitions. Italian-language media reports her saying that the Di Centa surname no longer weighs on her as it once did. ([il Nord Est](https://www.ilnordest.it/dossier/olimpiadi-milano-cortina-2026/di-centa-martina-skiathlon-intervista-olimpiadi-awegwdni))
- **Notable personal stories:** In Summer 2020, she suffered from **retrocalcaneal bursitis** that disrupted her training, forcing her to cross-train exclusively on a road bike. Her recovery and return to competition required patience and adaptation. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Di_Centa))
- **Personality/reputation:** A "figlia e nipote d'arte" (daughter and niece of champions), Martina carries the weight of one of cross-country skiing's most decorated families. The combined tally of her father Giorgio (3 Olympic medals) and aunt Manuela (7 Olympic medals) totals 10 Olympic medals. She is a member of the Carabinieri sports group (C.S. Carabinieri), one of Italy's premier military sports programs. Despite the enormous family legacy, she has grown more comfortable with her surname and is focused on writing her own story on the course.
