## Personal Life & Background
- **Hometown/Birthplace:** Born on February 1, 2000. Grew up in Vecbebri, a tiny village of only about 500 residents in the Aizkraukle municipality of Latvia, approximately 50 km west of the Latvian ski centre of Madona. She continues to return to Vecbebri at the end of each season, maintaining a deep connection to her roots. The village is known for its 19th-century manor, to which Patricija has a sentimental attachment.

- **Family:** Has six siblings -- she is the second youngest and the only girl among seven children. Her brother Valts Eiduks represented Latvia at the 2006 Winter Olympics in cross-country skiing. Her father Ingus Eiduks was her long-time coach from early childhood until 2018 and had been preparing his daughter for the Olympic Games since a very early age. Tragically, Ingus died on November 2, 2021, due to COVID-19 complications. Her six brothers have been described as "priceless support" throughout her career. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patr%C4%ABcija_Eiduka), [Riga IFF](https://rigaiff.lv/en/distribution/patricija/)
- **How she started skiing:** Started skiing at age three in Vecbebri. Until 2018, her father was her only coach. Training conditions in Vecbebri were challenging -- she had to drive 30 minutes to the nearest ski track in winter, or one hour to the roller ski track in summer; even for a normal running session, she had to walk about 30 minutes to the forest. As a teenager, she also practiced biathlon, but at age 16, she and her father decided to focus exclusively on cross-country skiing because *"skiing is undeniably closer to my heart. It brings joy and pleasure."* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patr%C4%ABcija_Eiduka), [Archysport](https://www.archysport.com/2020/12/patricia-eiduka-no-longer-plans-to-focus-on-biathlon/), [FIS Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/last-seasons-u-23-winner-patricija-eiduka)
- **Training odyssey:** After her father's coaching, she joined Team Haanja (Estonian-based), then trained with the Polish women's team under legendary Olympic champion Justyna Kowalczyk for four years, and later joined Team Aker Daehlie in Norway under coach Vinjerui, who brought her in *"because she is a good runner from a small nation... The Latvian national team is even smaller [than the British]. There she gets absolutely no sporting support."* [Langrenn.com](https://www.langrenn.com/langrenn-allround/vi-matte-plukke-av-henne-litt-av-treningskulturen-hennes/), [FIS Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/last-seasons-u-23-winner-patricija-eiduka)
- **Education:** [DATA NOT FOUND]
- **Hobbies/Interests:** [DATA NOT FOUND]
- **Documentary film:** A documentary titled *Patricia* (*Patricija*), directed by experienced sports journalists, follows her family through the trials of the sports industry. It was featured at the Riga International Film Festival. The film steps away from predictable sports dramas to ask: *"Is there anything else beyond the starts, the competitions, and the invisible path of preparation?"* [Riga IFF](https://rigaiff.lv/en/distribution/patricija/)
- **Nickname:** Affectionately known as "Pace." [FIS Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/last-seasons-u-23-winner-patricija-eiduka)
- **Awards:** Latvian Athlete of the Year 2020 -- the first representative of skiing and the first winter sports athlete in the 16-year history of the award to win the title. [FIS News](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2020-21/patricija-eiduka-latvian-s-best-athlete-of-2020)
- **Quotes:** *"I really like cross-country skiing, and that's the only reason I wanted to continue my career... skiing is undeniably closer to my heart. It brings joy and pleasure."* -- [Archysport](https://www.archysport.com/2020/12/patricia-eiduka-no-longer-plans-to-focus-on-biathlon/)
- **Notable personal stories:** Her physical profile is notably small (1.60m, 50kg), making her one of the lightest athletes on the World Cup circuit. Her journey from a village of 500 people with no proper training facilities to the World Cup top 30 -- overcoming the loss of her father-coach, training across four different national programs, and representing the smallest skiing nation on the circuit -- is one of the most compelling stories in cross-country skiing.

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Good -- has developed her classic technique substantially since training with Justyna Kowalczyk and the Polish team. Originally focused primarily on skating. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patr%C4%ABcija_Eiduka), [FIS Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/last-seasons-u-23-winner-patricija-eiduka))
- **Freestyle strength:** Very strong -- her natural and preferred technique. Career-best results have come predominantly in freestyle events (8th in 10km F at Davos, 5th in 20km F pursuit at Oberstdorf) ([Daily Skier](https://dailyskier.com/2020/12/16/flying-latvian-patricija-eiduka-20-causes-sensation-at-davos/))
- **Sprint ability:** Competent -- regularly makes sprint finals, ranked 40th in WC sprint standings with 87 points; stronger in sprint than many pure distance skiers
- **Distance preference:** All-around, but strongest at 10-20km distance
- **Best format:** Individual interval start and pursuit races in freestyle technique
- **Climbing ability:** Good -- her small frame (1.60m, 50kg) can be an advantage on technical uphills; solid Tour de Ski performance including the Final Climb

## Venue History
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Time Back |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Dec 2025 - Jan 2026 | Tour de Ski | Multiple stages | 24th overall | +6:51.8 |
| 7 Feb 2026 | Olympic Skiathlon | 20km Skiathlon C/F | 23rd | +4:17.2 |

| 10 Feb 2026 | Olympic Sprint | Sprint Classic Qual. | 35th (DNQ) | +15.21; did not advance to QF |

Eiduka raced at Val di Fiemme during the Tour de Ski (including the Final Climb), at the Olympic Skiathlon in Tesero, and in the Sprint Classic qualification. Her 23rd in the Olympic skiathlon was a solid result and represents good venue familiarity going into this 10km free race. The sprint qualification effort 2 days before the 10km should have minimal impact since she only raced the single qualification run.

## Key Storylines
- **Third Olympics at age 26:** This is Eiduka's third Olympic Games (2018, 2022, 2026). At just 26, she already has enormous Olympic experience. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patr%C4%ABcija_Eiduka))
- **Family legacy and loss:** Her father Ingus Eiduks, who was her long-time coach and introduced her to skiing, died on 2 November 2021 due to COVID-19 complications. Her brother Valts Eiduks represented Latvia at the 2006 Olympics. Patricija has six siblings and is the only girl among seven children. She races with deep personal motivation. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patr%C4%ABcija_Eiduka))
- **From Vecbebri to the world:** She grew up in the tiny village of Vecbebri (population 500) in the Aizkraukle municipality. Her story from rural Latvia to the World Cup top 30 is remarkable. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patr%C4%ABcija_Eiduka))
- **Training odyssey:** After her father's coaching, she joined the Estonian team, then trained with the Polish team under Justyna Kowalczyk, demonstrating extraordinary resourcefulness for an athlete from a small skiing nation. ([FIS Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/last-seasons-u-23-winner-patricija-eiduka))
- **Freestyle specialist in a free race:** The 10km free plays to her strongest technique. Her 15th at Davos 10km F and career-best 5th at Oberstdorf in freestyle pursuits suggest she could perform well in this event.
- **Sprint classic 2 days ago (Feb 10):** Finished 35th in the sprint qualification (4:01.42, +15.21s), failing to advance to the QFs. Sprint is not her strongest discipline, and the result confirms the 10km free is where she should focus her Olympic energy.
- **Olympic skiathlon bounce-back:** Her 23rd in the skiathlon was respectable but the classic half likely held her back. In a pure freestyle race, she may move up significantly.
