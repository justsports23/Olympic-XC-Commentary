### How She Started Skiing
Nissinen is part of Finland's deep cross-country skiing tradition, competing for **Vuokatti Ski Team Kainuu**. She has been coached for most of her career by **Mikko Virtanen** (12 years), before switching to coach **Jarmo Riski** in January 2023 ([Vuokatti Ski Team](https://vuokattiskiteam.fi/hiihtajat/vilma-nissinen/)).

### Hobbies & Interests
Her hobbies include **music, friends, sports, and writing** ([Vauhti Speed](https://vauhti.fi/en/vilma-nissinen/)). Writing is a notable interest for a cross-country skier and suggests a reflective, introspective personality.

### Olympic Flame & Community Role
Nissinen lit the **Olympic flame** during the opening ceremonies of the Winter European Youth Olympic Festival (EYOF) in Vuokatti, Sotkamo, in March 2022 -- a recognition of her status within the Vuokatti community and Finnish winter sports ([Wikipedia (fi)](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilma_Nissinen)).

### COVID & Missed 2022 Olympics
A COVID infection derailed her chances of making the 2022 Beijing Olympic team, making these 2026 Games her long-awaited Olympic debut at age 28 ([Olympiakomitea](https://www.olympiakomitea.fi/kisat-ja-joukkue/urheilijat/vilma-nissinen/)).

### Controversy (January 2026)
In January 2026, Nissinen made a controversial public comment to Finnish media, comparing the Vantaa district of Hakunila to Mogadishu. The Finnish Ski Federation distanced itself from her remarks, and city leaders criticized the comparison. She promptly apologized: *"The comment I made immediately after the race was inappropriate and out of place. I sincerely apologise."* ([Helsinki Times](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/28378-finnish-skier-apologises-after-comparing-vantaa-to-mogadishu.html))

## Career Highlights
- **Olympic Games:** First Olympic appearance — Milano Cortina 2026. Competed in the skiathlon (40th) on Feb 7, 2026 ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/ccs/ms/w/skiathln----------/fnl-/000100--/race-result)). A COVID infection ruined her chances of making the 2022 Beijing team ([Olympiakomitea](https://www.olympiakomitea.fi/kisat-ja-joukkue/urheilijat/vilma-nissinen/)).
- **World Championships:** 15th in the 50km Freestyle Mass Start at Trondheim 2025 (2:37:29.9, +12:34.6) — the first-ever women's 50km at a major championship ([FIS Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=CC&raceid=46945)). Also competed at Oberstdorf 2021: 22nd in 15km skiathlon, 29th in 30km classic mass start ([Wikipedia (fi)](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilma_Nissinen)).
- **Marathon Racing:** Won the Finlandia Ski Marathon Freestyle 62km in Lahti on Feb 23, 2025 (3:06:52.0), beating Rebecca Immonen by 4 seconds ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/long-distance/tossavainen-and-nissinen-winners-at-finlandia-ski-marathon-freestyle-2025/)).
- **Finnish Championships:** Bronze in 10km Classic at Vöyri 2020 and Imatra 2025; SM Pair Sprint champion (Freestyle 2020, Classic 2021) with Katri Lylynpera; 3x5km Relay champion 2024 with Lylynpera and Jasmin Kahara ([Wikipedia (fi)](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilma_Nissinen)).
- **Junior/U23 Worlds:** Competed at Junior Worlds in Rasnov 2016 and Soldier Hollow 2017 (best: 17th in combined, 2017). U23 results at Lahti 2019: 8th in 15km Classic Mass Start, 13th in Classic Sprint. Oberwiesenthal 2020: 8th in 10km Classic ([Wikipedia (fi)](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilma_Nissinen)).
- **World Cup Career:** Best World Cup result this season: 18th in 10km Freestyle at Davos (Dec 2025). Has twice finished inside the top 20 at World Cup level during 2024-25 ([FIS Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=192133&type=result)).

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Solid — SM bronze in 10km classic, competed in 20km classic pursuit at Tour de Ski (22nd). Has strong marathon pedigree in both techniques.
- **Freestyle strength:** Strong — her best World Cup result (18th, Davos) came in a 10km freestyle interval start. Won the Finlandia Ski Marathon in freestyle. FIS distance points (33.69) reflect competence across techniques.
- **Sprint ability:** Limited — ranked 100th in World Cup sprint standings with only 4 points. Sprint qualification results typically in the 40s.
- **Distance preference:** Long distance / marathon specialist. 15th in the inaugural women's 50km at Worlds; Finlandia Marathon winner. Best suited to races 20km and above, but competitive over 10km as well.
- **Best format:** Interval start (18th in 10km F interval at Davos) and mass start distance events (22nd in 20km pursuit at TdS).
- **Climbing ability:** [UNVERIFIED] — Her marathon strength suggests reasonable climbing endurance, but no specific climbing data available. The Tesero course's moderate climbing profile should suit her stamina.

## Venue History
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Time Back |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2026-01-04 | Tour de Ski Finale | 10km F Mass Start (Val di Fiemme) | [DATA NOT FOUND — included in TdS overall 25th] | — |
| 2026-02-07 | Olympic Games | Skiathlon 10/10km C/F | 40th | +6:52.5 |

Nissinen raced at Val di Fiemme during the Tour de Ski finale (January 2026), finishing the Tour 25th overall. She also competed at the Olympic skiathlon at the Tesero venue on Feb 7, where she was involved in a fall that disrupted the race. ([FIS Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=192133&type=result))

## Key Storylines
- **Olympic Skiathlon Fall (Feb 7, 2026):** Nissinen was at the center of a major incident on the opening lap of the Olympic skiathlon in wet, slushy conditions. She fell on a downhill turn, which disrupted several other skiers including American star Jessie Diggins, who suffered bruised ribs and was knocked out of medal contention ([NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/frida-karlsson-wins-gold-skiathlon-jessie-diggins-caught-lap-mishap)). Nissinen herself finished 40th, far below her typical form. The incident and its aftermath may affect her confidence heading into the 10km freestyle.
- **First Olympic Games:** After missing the 2022 Beijing Olympics due to COVID, this is Nissinen's long-awaited Olympic debut at age 28. The skiathlon result was disappointing, making the 10km an important redemption opportunity ([Olympiakomitea](https://www.olympiakomitea.fi/kisat-ja-joukkue/urheilijat/vilma-nissinen/)).
- **Marathon to World Cup Transition:** Nissinen won the 62km Finlandia Marathon in February 2025 and finished 15th in the 50km at Worlds the following month, then broke through at World Cup level this season with multiple top-25 finishes.
- **Controversy (Jan 2026):** Nissinen made a controversial public comment to Finnish media about skiing in Italy. The Finnish Ski Federation distanced itself from her remarks, stating that racism is not accepted ([Wikipedia (fi)](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilma_Nissinen)). This may have added off-course distractions.
- **Coaching Change:** Previously coached for 12 years by Mikko Virtanen; since January 2023 coached by Jarmo Riski ([Vuokatti Ski Team](https://vuokattiskiteam.fi/hiihtajat/vilma-nissinen/)).
