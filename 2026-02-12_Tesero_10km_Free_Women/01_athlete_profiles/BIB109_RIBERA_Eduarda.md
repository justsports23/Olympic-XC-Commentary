## Personal Life & Background
- **Hometown:** Originally from Rondonia, Brazil; the family relocated to Jundiai, Sao Paulo, when she was an infant, so that her brother Cristian could receive medical treatment for arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (a congenital joint disease) ([Olympics.com (pt)](https://www.olympics.com/pt/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/eduarda-ribera-familia-jogos-olimpicos-paralimpicos))
- **Nickname:** "Duda" ([Olympics.com (pt)](https://www.olympics.com/pt/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/eduarda-ribera-esqui-cross-country-perfil-biografia-resultados-brasileira-jogos-olimpicos-inverno-milano-cortina-2026))
- **Family — a remarkable sports dynasty:**
  - **Mother Solange:** The driving force of the Ribera Westemaier household. She loved football from a young age but did not have the opportunities, so she planted the seed of sport in her children. More than just an encourager, Solange competes in amateur cycling events and participates in training activities ([Olympics.com (pt)](https://www.olympics.com/pt/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/eduarda-ribera-familia-jogos-olimpicos-paralimpicos))
  - **Brother Cristian Ribera:** Two years older than Duda, born with arthrogryposis — doctors did not think he would survive the day of his birth. He became a decorated Paralympic cross-country skier: 6th at PyeongChang 2018, 9th at Beijing 2022, sprint title winner at 2025 Paralympic World Championships, and Crystal Globe winner for the 2025 Paralympic World Cup overall classification. He will compete at the 2026 Paralympic Winter Games in Milano Cortina and is a legitimate gold medal contender ([Olympics.com (en)](https://www.olympics.com/en/video/cristian-ribera-brazil-winter-paralympic-teen-inspiration))
  - **Brother Fabio Ribera:** The eldest sibling, age 30, graduated in Physical Education and serves as physical trainer and coach for both Duda and Cristian. Named Coach of the Season 2024/25 by the Brazilian Confederation of Snow Sports (CBDN) ([Olympics.com (pt)](https://www.olympics.com/pt/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/eduarda-ribera-familia-jogos-olimpicos-paralimpicos))
- **How she started skiing:** Grew up accompanying her brother Cristian to rollerski training (the asphalt version of skiing). His coach encouraged her to train, and she realized she had a future in the sport. Just months after starting, she was already participating in an international competition in Argentina ([Olympics.com (pt)](https://www.olympics.com/pt/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/eduarda-ribera-esqui-cross-country-perfil-biografia-resultados-brasileira-jogos-olimpicos-inverno-milano-cortina-2026))
- **Last-minute Olympic debut:** At just 17, Duda boarded a last-minute flight to Beijing 2022 after Bruna Moura suffered a car crash and could not compete. It was a sudden, emotional call-up that thrust her onto the Olympic stage ([Olympics.com (pt)](https://www.olympics.com/pt/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/eduarda-ribera-esqui-cross-country-perfil-biografia-resultados-brasileira-jogos-olimpicos-inverno-milano-cortina-2026))
- **Youth Olympics:** Made her international debut at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in Lausanne ([Olympics.com (pt)](https://www.olympics.com/pt/noticias/cinco-curiosidades-sobre-eduarda-ribera-jogos-de-inverno))
- **Milano Cortina 2026 family moment:** The entire Ribera Westemaier delegation — Duda (Olympic), Cristian (Paralympic), Fabio (coach), and their parents — will all be in Italy together. The parents are making their first trip outside of Brazil ([Olympics.com (pt)](https://www.olympics.com/pt/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/eduarda-ribera-familia-jogos-olimpicos-paralimpicos))

## Key Storylines

She will also compete in the freestyle team sprint with Bruna Moura.
