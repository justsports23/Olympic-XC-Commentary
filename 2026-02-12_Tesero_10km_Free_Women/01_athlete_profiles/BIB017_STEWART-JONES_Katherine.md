[Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/katherine-stewart-jones/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Stewart-Jones)
- **Family:** Grew up with three siblings in an intensely athletic family. Her twin sister Emilie was also a cross-country skier who competed at the World Junior Championships. Her older brother Patrick competed at the World Juniors, World U23s, and on the World Cup circuit. Her older brother Andrew was a competitive rower who won silver in the coxed pair at the 2016 World Rowing Championships. Katherine believes she became a gritty athlete because she always had to keep up with her older siblings.

- **How she started skiing:** Started cross-country skiing at age two, introduced by her parents. She did not enjoy it much at first and was mostly motivated by candy. She competed at her first national championships at age 15 and developed through the Nakkertok Nordic Ski Club system. [Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/katherine-stewart-jones/)

- **Concussion story:** In September 2017, she experienced a concussion while riding her bike -- a daunting setback during an Olympic year. She described the aftermath: *"I was sleeping like crazy. My eyes would get really tired. I had a lot of sensitivity to light and sounds."* She also needed a root canal after the accident. The experience has made her an advocate for concussion awareness in sport. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2018/01/rethinking-concussions-katherine-stewart-jones-personal-journey/)
- **Quotes:** On her Olympic experience and PyeongChang alternate status: Being named an alternate for the 2018 Olympics was agonizing at the time, but it motivated her move to Canmore for full-time training, which ultimately led to making the 2022 and 2026 Olympic teams. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Stewart-Jones)
- **Notable personal stories:** She is a Classroom Champions ambassador, mentoring young students through sport-based learning.

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Strong -- consistently competitive in classic distance races; 27th in World Championship 10km classic (2025), anchored strong relay performances ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/katherine-stewart-jones/))
- **Freestyle strength:** Strong -- her career-best 4th place came in a 20km freestyle mass start; good at longer freestyle distances ([Ottawa Sports Pages](https://ottawasportspages.ca/2025/01/07/high-achievers-weekend-wrap-nakkertok-nordics-katherine-stewart-jones-rebounds-for-career-best-4th-place-during-tour-de-ski/))

- **Distance preference:** Prefers longer distances (15-30km), but capable at 10km
- **Best format:** Mass start and pursuit races -- her best career results have come in mass start/pursuit formats (4th in 20km free mass start, 7th in 15km pursuit classic)
- **Climbing ability:** Good -- Val di Fiemme is described as one of her "feel-good locations," which features the demanding Alpe Cermis climb ([Rocky Mountain News](https://www.rmoutlook.com/2026-olympics/katherine-stewart-jones-bow-valley-olympian-at-milano-cortina-2026-11826949))

## Venue History
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Time Back |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Jan 2025 | Tour de Ski | 20km F Mass Start | **4th** | +0:07.58 |
| Jan 2025 | Tour de Ski | 15km C Pursuit | **7th** | [DATA NOT FOUND] |
| 7 Feb 2026 | Olympic Skiathlon | 20km Skiathlon C/F | 46th | +8:02.2 |

Val di Fiemme / Tesero is a venue with significant positive history for Stewart-Jones. Her two best career World Cup results (4th and 7th) came at Toblach/Val di Fiemme during the 2024-25 Tour de Ski. She described the venue as a "feel-good" location. However, her Olympic skiathlon result (46th) at the same venue was disappointing and suggests form may have dipped since her strong 2024-25 season.

## Key Storylines
- **Second Olympics:** This is Stewart-Jones' second Olympic Games after Beijing 2022. She was named an alternate for PyeongChang 2018, which was agonizing at the time, but it motivated her move to Canmore for full-time training. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Stewart-Jones))
- **Disappointing skiathlon:** Her 46th place in the Olympic skiathlon (7 Feb 2026) was well below her capabilities and marks a significant drop from her strong 2024-25 form. She will be looking to bounce back in this 10km free. ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/54162))
- **Venue familiarity:** Val di Fiemme is where she earned her career-best World Cup results (4th, 7th) during the Tour de Ski. She knows this terrain well. ([Rocky Mountain News](https://www.rmoutlook.com/2026-olympics/katherine-stewart-jones-bow-valley-olympian-at-milano-cortina-2026-11826949))
- **Canada's leader:** She has been Canada's top-ranked female cross-country skier for 5 consecutive years, a remarkable run of consistency for a smaller Nordic nation. ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/katherine-stewart-jones/))
- **Coaching setup:** Relocated from Chelsea, QC to Canmore, AB to train with coach Erik Bra ten, while still representing her home club Nakkertok. ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2020/06/settled-in-canmore-and-making-gains-katherine-stewart-jones/))
- **Nakkertok legacy:** Her club, Nakkertok Nordic, has won the National Club Championship 9 consecutive times, reflecting the strong development environment she comes from. ([Nakkertok](https://nakkertok.ca/nakkertok-wins-national-club-championship/?lang=en))
