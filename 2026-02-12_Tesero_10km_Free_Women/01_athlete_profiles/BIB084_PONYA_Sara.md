She was educated at Eszterhazy Karoly Catholic University ([Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28870451)). Ponya learned to ski at the remarkably young age of two and developed a passion for competition early in life ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/hungarian-cross-country-skiing-team-confirmed-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)). Before committing to cross-country skiing and biathlon, she competed in alpine skiing and kayaking ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/hungarian-cross-country-skiing-team-confirmed-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)). Her first biathlon year was 2016, and she uses Salomon skis and an Anschutz rifle ([IBU Profile](https://www.biathlonworld.com/athlete/ponya-sara/BTHUN21405199901)). She has called the biathlon community "supportive and united," saying it "constantly helps me become a better version of myself" ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/hungarian-cross-country-skiing-team-confirmed-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)).
