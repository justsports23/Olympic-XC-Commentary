## Personal Life & Background
Ilic was born on 30 October 1998 in Uzice, Serbia, and comes from Zlatibor, a mountainous region in western Serbia with a long tradition in Nordic skiing ([Telegraf.rs](https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/zimske-olimpijske-igre/4264990-ko-je-anja-ilic-devojka-koja-predstavlja-srbiju-na-zimskim-olimpijskim-igrama-vec-je-ispisala-nasu-istoriju)). Her married name is Ilic (nee Eric) ([Zlatibor.tv](https://zlatibor.tv/tag/anja-ilic/)). She began skiing as a child, inspired by her older sister Mina, who was the first in the family to start training. She has said: "I looked up to her, and when I started winning, I got hooked and a great love was born" ([Telegraf.rs](https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/zimske-olimpijske-igre/4264990-ko-je-anja-ilic-devojka-koja-predstavlja-srbiju-na-zimskim-olimpijskim-igrama-vec-je-ispisala-nasu-istoriju)). Her father founded the ski club Zvezda in Zlatibor, where Anja trains, and he also served as her coach ([Infoera](https://infoera.rs/2026/02/10/skijasica-sa-zlatibora-na-olimpijskom-debiju/)). Her family has been her biggest support throughout her career. In an emotional social media post about qualifying for her first Olympics, Anja credited her sister Mina, her husband Strahinja, her family, and her friends, saying they never stopped believing in her "crazy" life and helped her grow "from a small, scared girl into a confident woman in sport who is achieving her dreams" ([Telegraf.rs](https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/zimske-olimpijske-igre/4264990-ko-je-anja-ilic-devojka-koja-predstavlja-srbiju-na-zimskim-olimpijskim-igrama-vec-je-ispisala-nasu-istoriju)). She became the Balkan champion in Nordic skiing -- the best result in Serbia's history -- after finishing in the top three at the Balkan Championships from 2018 to 2021 ([Radio Luna](https://www.radioluna.info/anja-ilic-prvakinja-balkana-u-nordijskom-skijanju/)). Her occupation is listed as "school student" on the FIS database ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=185115&type=result)).
