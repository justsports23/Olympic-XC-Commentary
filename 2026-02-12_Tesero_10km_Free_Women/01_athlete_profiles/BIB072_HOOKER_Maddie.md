- **Family:** Her father is Jake Hooker and her mother is Antoinette Walshe. Her father was at the cross-country skiing venue for her Olympic debut, joking: "What other sport would you actually turn up for the Olympics not actually having done the event? Why not start at the Olympics?" Her parents helped her find a pair of the rare boots used by cross-country skiers in skiathlon events ahead of her first-ever skiathlon race at the Olympics.

- **How she started skiing:** Although Hooker spent much of her childhood in the pool training as a competitive swimmer, she found freedom in skiing. She learned to ski on family trips to the United States. She eventually moved from Melbourne to attend Stratton Mountain School, a skiing-focused high school in Vermont. After returning to Australia for a year following Stratton, she made the Australian junior national team and qualified for the junior world championships.

- **Education:** Currently a junior (Class of 2027) at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, double majoring in economics and mathematics. Colby is a Division III school, but the Alpine and Nordic teams compete in Division I in the Eastern Collegiate Ski Association (ECSCA), racing against UVM, Harvard, and Dartmouth. Her coach Tracey Cote has said: "She's clearly established herself as the top skier on our team." Hooker has praised Colby's Harold Alfond Athletics and Recreation Center, describing it as "better than the Australian Olympic training center."

- **Notable quotes:** "It's always been a dream to go to the Olympics. To be living that dream out now is amazing. I'm just trying to take it all in. I wasn't expecting to make it to the Olympics this year, so it was kind of a surprise and delight."

She had never competed in a skiathlon before the Olympics. She was lapped and pulled from the skiathlon after completing approximately three-quarters of the race. Her Olympic berth came as a surprise even to herself, secured by strong early-season results.
