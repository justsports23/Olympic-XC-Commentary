## Key Storylines
Tita is a second-generation Greek cross-country skier — her father Christos Titas also represented Greece in the sport. Born in Florina, a mountainous town in northern Greece, she is one of very few Greek athletes in Nordic skiing. At just 23, this is her second Olympics after debuting at Beijing 2022. She also has biathlon experience from her youth, giving her versatility across winter endurance sports. Notably, she turns 23 on race day (11 February is her birthday, though the 10km free is on 12 February, so she will have just celebrated). She led the Greek delegation at the Parade of Nations at the Milano Cortina 2026 Opening Ceremony, where Greece traditionally opens as the birthplace of the Olympics.
