## Personal Life & Background
- **Born:** 1 February 1993, Schladming, Austria ([Wikipedia - Teresa Stadlober](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Stadlober))
- **Hometown:** Radstadt, Salzburg, Austria -- a small town in the Enns Valley known as a "Home of Champions" for the high proportion of top athletes it has produced ([Radstadt Tourism](https://www.radstadt.com/en/radstadt/home-of-champions/))
- **Father -- Alois Stadlober:** A five-time Olympian (1984, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1998) in cross-country skiing, with 12 top-15 Olympic finishes. He was also a 1999 World relay champion and sprint silver medalist at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships. ([Wikipedia - Alois Stadlober](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alois_Stadlober))
- **Mother -- Roswitha Steiner:** A former Alpine skier who won a silver medal at the 1987 World Championships and was a two-time Olympian. ([Wikipedia - Roswitha Steiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswitha_Steiner))
- **Brother -- Luis Stadlober:** Also a competitive cross-country skier, World Championship and Olympic participant. Luis is now Teresa's training partner as part of "Team Teresa Stadlober." ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/teresa-stadlober-the-austrian-olympic-medalist/))
- **How she started skiing:** Teresa practically grew up on skis thanks to her two Olympian parents. She first tried alpine skiing at age 2 on the baby lift in Radstadt with her mother as instructor, then soon after was put on cross-country skis. She competed in her first race at age four -- the "Mini-Tauernlauf" in Altenmarkt, with her mother accompanying her by foot. She finished last but did not mind, happily enjoying the giant pretzel she received at the finish line. ([Fischer Sports](https://www.fischersports.com/ca_en/news/do-what-makes-you-happy-teresa-stadlober), [Teresa Stadlober Official Website](https://www.teresa-stadlober.at/))
- **Education:** Attended Volksschule (elementary school) in Radstadt, then the Missionsprivatgymnasium St. Rupert in Bischofshofen from 2003 to 2011, earning her Matura (Austrian high school diploma). ([Teresa Stadlober Official Website](https://www.teresa-stadlober.at/))
- **Career outside sport:** From 2012 to 2023, she worked as an office employee at Jerich International in Gleisdorf. Since November 2023, she has been a police elite athlete (Polizeispitzensportlerin), a common arrangement in Austria for top athletes. ([Teresa Stadlober Official Website](https://www.teresa-stadlober.at/))
- **Notable story:** At the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, while running in 2nd place in the 30km classic with 7km to go, Teresa took a wrong turn on the course, ultimately finishing 9th. It became one of the most heartbreaking moments in Olympic XC skiing history. She said afterward: "I don't know why I took the wrong way." Four years later at Beijing 2022, she won Austria's first-ever female Olympic medal in cross-country skiing (bronze in skiathlon) -- a powerful redemption story. ([ESPN](http://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/22574076), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/02/25/i-dont-know-why-i-took-the-wrong-way-wrong-turn-costs-austrian-skier-a-medal/))

## Key Storylines
- **Redemption arc from PyeongChang 2018:** The infamous wrong-turn incident in the 30km classic at PyeongChang, where she was running 2nd with 7km to go before veering off course and finishing 9th, is one of Olympic XC skiing's most heartbreaking moments. She redeemed herself with Olympic bronze in Beijing 2022. Now at age 33, she arrives at her fourth Olympics in the form of her life. ([ESPN](http://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/22574076))
- **Career-best season:** 2025-26 is statistically Stadlober's best season — 4th in World Cup overall, Tour de Ski runner-up with the Climber's Bib, four World Cup podiums. She has never been more competitive. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/cross-country-world-cup-2025-2026-updated-standings-after-oberhof/))
- **Arrived at Olympics with a cold:** Stadlober traveled to the Games while fighting illness, which affected her skiathlon (9th). She indicated the skating portion went well and expressed confidence for the 10km free. ([ORF Sport](https://sport.orf.at/milanocortina2026/stories/3151161/))
- **Family legacy:** Daughter of Alois Stadlober (five-time Olympian, 1999 World relay champion) and Roswitha Steiner (Alpine World Championship silver medalist 1987, two-time Olympian). Brother Luis Stadlober also competed in XC skiing. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/teresa-stadlober-the-austrian-olympic-medalist/))
- **Austria's lone star:** She is essentially the sole top-level woman on the Austrian XC team, competing without the support of a deep national squad. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/austrian-cross-country-ski-teams-for-season-2025-2026/))
- **Skipped Goms to prepare for Olympics:** After Oberhof, Stadlober chose to skip the Goms World Cup and go directly into Olympic training, signaling strong focus on these Games.
