## Personal Life & Background
Anna Melnik was born on February 5, 1998, and is based in Schuchinsk, Kazakhstan, where she trains with the Ski Schuchinsk Team and CSKA KAZ ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=196451)). She speaks Russian and English and lists golf among her hobbies ([FIS - Roller Skiing Guide](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/roller-skiing-essential-guide)).

Melnik first got on roller skis at age 13 when she joined a cross-country skiing class at a children's sports school. "I first got on roller skis aged 13, when I joined a Cross-Country Skiing class at a children's sports school," she recalls. Since it was autumn, her first steps toward skiing were actually on roller skis ([FIS - Roller Skiing Guide](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/roller-skiing-essential-guide)). In Kazakhstan, roller skiing is an integral part of ski training for all ages, and after becoming comfortable on roller skis, it was much easier for her to transition to snow skis ([FIS - Roller Skiing Guide](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/roller-skiing-essential-guide)).

As a dual-discipline athlete excelling in both cross-country and roller skiing, Melnik has candidly acknowledged the realities of competing for a smaller skiing nation: "Kazakhstan isn't a 'super' skiing nation. We don't have lucrative contracts with major equipment manufacturers, but there's a greater chance to achieve good results in roller skiing than in cross-country, and I can even fight for the overall title." She appreciates roller skiing's level playing field: "I really like that everyone gets the same roller skis. Victory depends solely on you and your physical fitness" ([FIS - Roller Skiing Guide](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/roller-skiing-essential-guide)).

Beyond skiing, Melnik is a versatile endurance athlete -- she won the women's race at the Race Nation Burabay obstacle course race in 2019, which qualified her for the OCR World Championships in London ([Astana Times](https://astanatimes.com/2019/10/more-than-500-cross-country-runners-compete-in-race-nation-burabay/)).
