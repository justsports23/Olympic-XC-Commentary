## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Childhood in Scotland
Anna Pryce was born on 7 December 2001 in Scotland and grew up in the countryside just outside Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, until she was almost six years old. Her very first experience on skis came in the family garden: when it snowed, her parents would send her out on skis down the hill. *"When Anna Pryce's parents plonked her on some skis and pushed her down the hill in the family garden in Inverurie, no one could have predicted that she would follow that route all the way to the Olympics."* ([Team GB](https://www.teamgb.com/article/anna-pryces-journey-from-inverurie-to-the-winter-olympics/poZZ3Ow3lKptTKcPDcLvP))

### Move to Canada & Career Path
When Pryce was five, her family moved to Canada, where skiing was easy to continue due to the abundant snow. She developed as a skier in the Canadian system, racing for the Canadian national team, and competed at the 2021 U23 World Ski Championships representing Canada. She described the eventual switch to Great Britain as *"really cool to have a full circle moment, representing the place I was born and learned to ski."* The decision to transfer came on the advice of fellow college skier Joe Davies, another member of the Team GB Nordic skiing team who had changed nationalities.

### Education -- Nursing Degree at Montana State University
Pryce spent four years in the United States, balancing a full-time nursing degree with competing for Montana State University (NCAA qualifier in 2022 at Soldier Hollow and 2023 at Lake Placid). She described the challenge: *"Sometimes I would have to come to a race a bit later than everyone else because I had to be in the hospital doing a clinical day... There were days when I was in the hospital for 12 hours or doing nights. The more and more I did nursing, the more I loved it. It took a while but I found a way to balance the two."* She graduated in May 2025, which freed her to focus fully on skiing: *"I've always been looking at the Olympics but when I finally graduated school, I felt I had time and could put my eggs into one basket. This year it became a real possibility in my head."* ([Team GB](https://www.teamgb.com/article/anna-pryces-journey-from-inverurie-to-the-winter-olympics/poZZ3Ow3lKptTKcPDcLvP)) ([Montana State Athletics](https://msubobcats.com/sports/womens-skiing/roster/anna-pryce/6942))

### Family -- Loss of Her Mother
The family aspect is particularly resonant for Pryce, whose mother passed away in 2025. She has spoken about the emotional weight of competing at the Olympics without her: *"I wish she were here. It's a bit hard, but my dad is very supportive."* ([Team GB](https://www.teamgb.com/article/anna-pryces-journey-from-inverurie-to-the-winter-olympics/poZZ3Ow3lKptTKcPDcLvP))

### Support from Scottish Sponsors
Scottish oatcake manufacturer Nairn's Oatcakes played a key role in enabling Scotland's leading female cross-country skiers, including Anna Pryce, to attend critical World Cup events and achieve the Olympic Qualification Standard for the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games.

## Key Storylines
Pryce's journey from a Scottish childhood in Inverurie, through Canadian national team skiing and a Montana State nursing degree, to becoming Team GB's first female Olympic cross-country skier in eight years is one of the most compelling stories at these Games. She transferred her FIS registration from Canada to Great Britain just months before the season and has been making rapid progress on the World Cup circuit. At 24, she is writing a new chapter for British Nordic skiing.
