## Personal Life & Background
- **Hometown/Birthplace:** Born on May 7, 2002, in Sydney, NSW, Australia. Grew up in Gordon, a suburb on Sydney's Upper North Shore, far from any snow. Currently resides in Fairbanks, Alaska. [OWIA](https://www.owia.org/rosie-fordham.html), [UAF Athletics](https://alaskananooks.com/sports/womens-skiing/roster/rosie-fordham/3964)
- **Family:** Daughter of Michael Fordham and Georgina Haysom. Has at least one brother, who joined her in trying cross-country skiing as a teenager. [UAF Athletics](https://alaskananooks.com/sports/womens-skiing/roster/rosie-fordham/3964)
- **How she started skiing:** Grew up playing every sport available -- soccer, cricket, netball, touch football, softball, and hockey -- but realized she had an aptitude for endurance sport and a lack of coordination in ball sports. Her family spent school holidays downhill skiing, and friends invited her brother and her to try cross-country skiing in the afternoons. From there, she did Interschools competitions and joined the NSWXC team at age 14. At age 9, after winning the school cross country running carnival, she told a friend she was going to go to the Olympics -- at the time, she did not know cross-country skiing was a sport. [OWIA](https://www.owia.org/rosie-fordham.html), [Snow Australia](https://www.snow.org.au/xc-national-team/cross-country-national-team-rosie-fordham/)
- **Education:** Attended Abbotsleigh School in Sydney, where she was a two-time Sportswoman of the Year (2018, 2020). Currently studying Statistics (Mathematics) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks on a scholarship. The statistics department has been supportive in allowing her to balance academics with international competition.

- **How she got to Alaska:** Cold-emailed dozens of US college programs looking for a skiing scholarship and received about three responses, including one from the University of Alaska Fairbanks coach. She recalled: *"All right, sounds good, sure, yeah, I want to get out of Australia."* She went to her parents and said, *"Yo, I'm going to Fairbanks."* And they asked, *"Where is that?"* [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/12/the-devon-kershaw-show-three-continents-a-135-mile-ski-session-and-a-world-cup-13th-meet-rosie-fordham/)
- **Life in Alaska:** Lives in a cabin without plumbing in Fairbanks, skiing out her front door to train. Has been described as having "a wild story" growing up in Sydney and randomly getting into cross-country skiing. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/12/the-devon-kershaw-show-three-continents-a-135-mile-ski-session-and-a-world-cup-13th-meet-rosie-fordham/), [UAF Aurora Magazine](https://www.uaf.edu/aurora/archives/summer-2025/skiing-out-the-door-and-ahead-of-the-competition.php)
- **Hobbies/Interests:** Cross-country running (NCAA Division II West Regional champion and Runner of the Year); dual-sport collegiate athlete competing in both Nordic skiing and cross-country running for UAF. [UAF Athletics](https://alaskananooks.com/sports/womens-cross-country/roster/rosie-fordham/3855)
- **Quotes:** *"There's no secret sauce. It's not magic. It's just like hard work and you just keep plodding along and eventually the results come."* -- [UAF Sun Star](https://www.uafsunstar.com/sports/five-nanooks-are-headed-to-the-winter-olympics/)
- **Notable personal stories:** Her path from Sydney to the Australian Olympic team via a cabin in Alaska is one of the most unconventional journeys in cross-country skiing. She trained under dual Winter Olympian Callum Watson with the NSW Cross-Country team before heading to Alaska. [OWIA](https://www.owia.org/rosie-fordham.html)
