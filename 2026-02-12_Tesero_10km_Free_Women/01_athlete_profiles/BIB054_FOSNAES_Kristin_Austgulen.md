## Key Storylines
- Fosnaes is in only her second season on Norway's senior national elite team, having made a rapid ascent from U23 gold medalist to World Championship relay silver medalist.
- At the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim, she experienced a dramatic and heartbreaking anchor leg in the relay, starting with a 37-second lead only to be overtaken by Sweden's Jonna Sundling. Despite the loss, her teammates were supportive -- Astrid Slind said "it feels like we won the silver today."
- She uses Atomic skis and boots with Swix poles.
- Her 11th place in the Olympic skiathlon shows she is capable of a top-15 result at the highest level, and this 10km free interval start race suits her distance strengths.
- Being seeded for this race suggests the Norwegian coaching staff sees her as a legitimate contender for a strong result.
