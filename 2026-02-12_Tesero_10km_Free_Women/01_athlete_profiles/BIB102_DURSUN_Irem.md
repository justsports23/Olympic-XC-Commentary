## Personal Life & Background
Irem Dursun (Turkish: Irem Dursun) was born on **26 August 2005 in Bolu, Turkey**, a mountainous province in northwestern Turkey known for its winter sports facilities and proximity to the Kartalkaya ski resort ([Wikipedia — Irem Dursun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irem_Dursun)). She began cross-country skiing in **December 2020** in the 5km interval start class, meaning she progressed from beginner to Olympic athlete in just five years — a remarkable trajectory ([Wikipedia — Irem Dursun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irem_Dursun)). She debuted internationally in **February 2021** at the FIS Junior World Ski Championships in Vuokatti, Finland, competing in sprint, 5km freestyle, and relay events ([Wikipedia — Irem Dursun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irem_Dursun)). In January 2023, she participated at the **European Youth Olympic Winter Festival** in Sappada, Italy, in multiple events including sprint and relay ([Wikipedia — Irem Dursun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irem_Dursun)). Notably, another Turkish cross-country skier, **Ozlem Ceren Dursun** (born 8 December 2003), shares the same surname and was also born in the Bolu province; while a family connection is plausible, it has not been confirmed in available sources ([Wikipedia — Ozlem Ceren Dursun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96zlem_Ceren_Dursun)). Turkey has participated in the Winter Olympics since 1936 but has never won a Winter Olympic medal. Dursun is one of two Turkish cross-country skiers at these Games, alongside Abdullah Yilmaz in men's events ([Hurriyet Daily News](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/nine-athletes-to-represent-turkiye-at-2026-winter-olympics-218088)).

## Key Storylines
Dursun is just 20 years old and making her Olympic debut, representing a Turkish cross-country skiing program that is still developing on the world stage. She only began the sport in 2020, making her rapid progression to the Olympics in just five years remarkable. Turkey has never won a Winter Olympic medal despite competing since 1936, so every appearance helps build the foundation for Turkish winter sport.
