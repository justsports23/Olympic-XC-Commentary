- **Quotes:**
  - *"She [Justyna Kowalczyk] has had tremendous results and has created something amazing. I want to write my own story and something new that will be mine. I want to be seen as Izabela Marcisz, not as Justyna Kowalczyk's successor."* -- on forging her own identity separate from Poland's greatest cross-country skier. ([Pho3nix Foundation](https://pho3nixfoundation.com/athletes/izabela-marcisz/))
- **Notable personal stories:** In July 2021, Marcisz suffered a **cracked mandible (lower jaw)** from a crash during a team roller skiing training camp in Strbske Pleso, Slovakia, requiring surgery at the University Hospital in Krakow. In November 2020, she was infected with COVID-19 and was confined at home for one month, disrupting her training. Despite these setbacks, she returned to win the U23 World Championship gold in 10km freestyle in 2021. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izabela_Marcisz); [Pho3nix Foundation](https://pho3nixfoundation.com/athletes/izabela-marcisz/))
- **Mentorship:** Olympic and World Champion **Justyna Kowalczyk** consults on her career, connecting Marcisz to Poland's greatest cross-country skiing legacy. ([Pho3nix Foundation](https://pho3nixfoundation.com/athletes/izabela-marcisz/))
- **Personality/reputation:** Considered the brightest talent and greatest hope in Polish cross-country skiing. She carries the legacy of compatriot Kowalczyk while determinedly building her own identity. The combination of overcoming serious injury, illness, and her family's multi-generational skiing heritage makes her one of the most compelling stories in the sport.

## Key Storylines
Izabela Marcisz is the most experienced of Poland's rising cross-country skiing generation, carrying the legacy of compatriot and Olympic champion Justyna Kowalczyk, who consults on her career. She overcame significant adversity including a cracked mandible from a roller skiing crash in 2021 and a month-long COVID-19 illness in 2020. Her U23 World Championship gold in the 10km freestyle in 2021 marked her as one of Poland's brightest talents. Now based in Sweden for training and supported by the Pho3nix Foundation, Marcisz enters the 10km free at Tesero as a realistic contender for a top-25 result based on her Ruka season-opener form (33rd in the skiathlon). The family connection is also notable -- she is one of three Marcisz sisters to compete in international cross-country skiing.
