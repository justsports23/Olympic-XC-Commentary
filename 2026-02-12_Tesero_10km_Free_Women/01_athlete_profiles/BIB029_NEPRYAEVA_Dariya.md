**Pronunciation:** *dah-REE-yah neh-PRYAH-yeh-vah*
**Bib:** 29 | **Start Time:** 13:14:30 | **DOB:** May 18, 2002 (age 23) | **Status:** Individual Neutral Athlete

---

## Event Context: 10km Interval Start Freestyle

This is a **distance freestyle** race — and distance is Dariya Nepryaeva's strength. Unlike the sprint classic on Feb 10 where her sprint FIS points (75.48) made qualification uncertain, the 10km free is her natural territory. Her FIS Distance Points of 24.87 (Rank 28) place her firmly in the competitive tier for this event. The interval start format is a pure test of fitness and pacing — ideal for a distance specialist.

## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Upbringing
Dariya Mikhailovna Nepryaeva was born on May 18, 2002, in **Tver, Russia**, into one of the country's most prominent cross-country skiing dynasties ([Wikipedia - Dariya Nepryaeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dariya_Nepryaeva)). From the age of five, she accompanied her parents and older sister to training camps and soon began skiing under the guidance of her mother and coach Alexander Smirnov ([Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032699/sofiia-tokareva/skier-daria-nepryaeva-broke-through-2026-olympics-how-athlete-got-license-milan)).

### Family — A Skiing Dynasty from Tver
- **Father -- Mikhail Nepryaev:** Former member of the Russian national ski racing team in the 1990s; now holds the post of Deputy Chief of Staff in the government of the Tver region and is a member of the leadership of the regional Ski Racing Federation ([Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032699/sofiia-tokareva/skier-daria-nepryaeva-broke-through-2026-olympics-how-athlete-got-license-milan))
- **Mother -- Irina Nepryaeva:** Former Russian national ski team member in the 1990s; now an Honored Coach of Russia in cross-country skiing. Graduated from Tver State University with a degree in physical education and sports ([Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032699/sofiia-tokareva/skier-daria-nepryaeva-broke-through-2026-olympics-how-athlete-got-license-milan))
- **Older sister -- Natalya Terentyeva (nee Nepryaeva):** Born September 6, 1995, also in Tver. Olympic champion in the 2022 relay, silver and bronze medalist at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, and bronze medalist at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics. One of the strongest Russian skiers of her generation. In a 2020 interview, Natalya expressed her dream: *"to run for Team Russia in relay with my younger sister, Darya"* ([DailySkier](https://dailyskier.com/2020/10/30/natalia-nepryaeva-i-dont-do-screaming-shouting-or-public-breaking-of-poles/)). Dariya has always considered Natalya her *"main guide and competitor"* ([Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032699/sofiia-tokareva/skier-daria-nepryaeva-broke-through-2026-olympics-how-athlete-got-license-milan))
- **Younger brother -- Dmitry Nepryaev:** Also engaged in cross-country skiing and already achieving success at children's competitions ([Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032699/sofiia-tokareva/skier-daria-nepryaeva-broke-through-2026-olympics-how-athlete-got-license-milan))

### Relationship
Dariya is in a relationship with skier **Sergey Volkov**, whom she met in the junior national team. She has admitted that the busy schedule of training camps and travel makes it difficult to communicate with people outside of sports ([Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032699/sofiia-tokareva/skier-daria-nepryaeva-broke-through-2026-olympics-how-athlete-got-license-milan)).

### Education
Nepryaeva was educated at the **Olympic Reserve School No. 1 in Tver** and studied at **Smolensk State University of Sports** in the Department of Theory and Methodology of Cross-country Skiing ([Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032699/sofiia-tokareva/skier-daria-nepryaeva-broke-through-2026-olympics-how-athlete-got-license-milan)). She holds the Master of Sports of Russia designation (awarded 2021) ([Wikipedia - Dariya Nepryaeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dariya_Nepryaeva)).

### How She Started Skiing
Born into a family where both parents were former Russian national team skiers, Dariya's path was set from early childhood. She began accompanying her family to training camps at age five and was soon training on skis under her mother's coaching ([Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032699/sofiia-tokareva/skier-daria-nepryaeva-broke-through-2026-olympics-how-athlete-got-license-milan)). By age 15, she was competing at the Central Federal District Junior Championships ([Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032699/sofiia-tokareva/skier-daria-nepryaeva-broke-through-2026-olympics-how-athlete-got-license-milan)).

### Notable Personal Stories
- **The emotional toll of the ban:** In October 2025, Dariya was in tears after the FIS initially upheld the suspension of Russian athletes, seemingly ending her Olympic dream. The CAS ruling on December 2, 2025 reversed this, and she went from banned to Olympic athlete in less than three months ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/nepryaeva-in-tears-after-fis-decision-to-uphold-russian-ban/))
- **Post-career aspirations:** In an interview, Dariya said that after completing her sports career, she would like to try her hand at business ([Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2032699/sofiia-tokareva/skier-daria-nepryaeva-broke-through-2026-olympics-how-athlete-got-license-milan))
- **Three-year gap:** The competition ban from February 2022 to December 2025 cost her nearly three years of international development during her peak junior-to-senior transition years, ages 20-23 ([Nordic Insights](https://nordicinsights.news/2025/12/10/f-i-s-grants-neutral-athlete-status-to-saveliy-korostelev-and-dariya-nepryaeva-ahead-of-davos/))

## The Political Storyline

The most politically charged entry in the field. Younger sister of **Natalya Nepryaeva** (3x Beijing Olympic medalist). Russian athletes were banned from FIS competition since February 2022; in December 2025, CAS overturned FIS's ban, clearing Dariya for return. She made her WC return at Davos (December 13) — her first international competition in approximately three years. IOC cleared her for Olympic participation under strict neutrality criteria — **no flag, no anthem**.

---

## Olympic Skiathlon Result (Feb 7, 2026)

Nepryaeva placed **17th in the Olympic skiathlon** on February 7. For a 23-year-old who was banned from international competition for nearly three years, a 17th-place finish in her first Olympic event demonstrates competitive fitness. The 10km freestyle — her stronger discipline — should suit her better than the skiathlon's classic-to-freestyle combination.

---

## Season Form & Distance Credentials
- **FIS Distance Points:** 24.87 (Rank 28) — solid distance credentials
- **FIS Sprint Points:** 75.48 (Rank 62) — sprint is not her discipline
- **Olympic skiathlon (Feb 7):** 17th — respectable given her three-year absence from international racing
- **Olympic sprint classic (Feb 10):** Competed in sprint qualification; did not advance to QFs (finished outside top 30) — confirms sprint is not her event. Competed 2 days before the 10km free. — [Izvestia](https://en.iz.ru/en/2039548/2026-02-10/skier-daria-nepryaeva-will-compete-sprint-olympics-february-10)
- **Goms 20km Classic (Jan 2026):** 8th — strong distance result
- **Davos Sprint (Dec 13):** 39th — confirms she is not a sprinter
- **Goms Sprint (Jan 2026):** 25th — again, sprint is secondary

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Freestyle strength:** Strong — the 10km free is a better fit than classic sprint
- **Classic strength:** Capable — 8th in Goms 20km classic shows solid classic ability
- **Distance preference:** **True distance specialist** — this 10km free is her ideal event at these Olympics
- **Sprint ability:** Limited at elite level (FIS Sprint Points 75.48)
- **Climbing ability:** [DATA NOT FOUND] — but distance fitness suggests adequate climbing capacity
- **10km Free assessment:** With her distance pedigree and FIS Distance Points of 24.87, a top-15 to top-20 finish is realistic. She is better positioned here than she was in the sprint classic.

## Key Storylines
1. **Racing without flag or anthem:** The neutrality conditions are a constant backdrop
2. **Sister connection:** Natalya Nepryaeva won 3 medals at Beijing 2022 — Dariya now has her own Olympic stage
3. **Three-year ban to Olympic athlete:** The CAS ruling in December 2025 changed everything — from banned to Olympic athlete in less than three months
4. **Distance is her discipline:** Unlike the sprint, the 10km free is where Nepryaeva belongs
5. **Sprint classic 2 days ago (Feb 10):** Competed in the sprint qualification but did not advance to QFs — confirming sprint is not her event. The effort 2 days before this 10km should have minimal impact given she only raced the qualification run.
6. **17th in the skiathlon:** Showed she can compete; now she has a chance in her stronger event

## Commentary Gold
- **Racing without flag or anthem** — one of the most politically charged entries at these Olympics
- Her sister **Natalya won 3 medals at Beijing 2022** — the Nepryaeva name carries weight in cross-country skiing
- The **CAS ruling in December 2025** changed everything — from banned to Olympic athlete in less than three months
- At just **23 years old**, she lost nearly three years of development to the competition ban — what might have been?
- **17th in the skiathlon** showed her competitiveness — the 10km free is a better fit for her profile
- **FIS Distance Points of 24.87** — she's a genuine distance competitor, not a sprint specialist out of depth
- The 10km free could be the race where she announces herself on the world stage
