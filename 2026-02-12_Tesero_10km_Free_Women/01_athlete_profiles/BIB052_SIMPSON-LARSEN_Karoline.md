- **Partner:** Johan-Olav Smørdal Botn, a Norwegian biathlete who won gold in the men's 20km individual biathlon at the 2026 Winter Olympics. The couple lives together in Lillehammer. After Simpson-Larsen's breakthrough World Cup victory in Davos, Botn sent her a touching public message: "I'm really proud of you."

- **Family background:** [DATA NOT FOUND] -- her hyphenated surname "Simpson-Larsen" may suggest mixed heritage, but no sources elaborate on her family origins
- **Tragic event:** On Christmas Eve 2025, biathlete Sivert Guttorm Bakken died on the Lavaze Pass in the Italian Dolomites. Simpson-Larsen and Botn were present when the tragedy occurred. Simpson-Larsen described it as "a very difficult day" and those who were at Lavaze stayed together during that time. Despite the emotional toll, she chose to compete in the Tour de Ski, and ultimately won the Final Climb stage at Alpe Cermis, dedicating the victory to Bakken: "I think that Sivert's spirit was with me on that climb."

## Career Highlights
- **2 World Cup victories (both 2025-26 season):**
  - 1st — 10km Interval Start Free, Davos (14 December 2025): Beat Moa Ilar (SWE) by 2.1 seconds
  - 1st — 10km Mass Start Free (Final Climb), Val di Fiemme (4 January 2026): Beat Jessie Diggins (USA) by 8.8 seconds
- **Tour de Ski 2025-26:** Won the iconic Final Climb stage at Alpe Cermis; finished in top 20 overall
- **2026 Olympic Games (Milano Cortina):** 13th in Skiathlon (7 February 2026) — her first Olympic competition
- **World Cup Distance Standing:** 3rd in the 2025-26 distance standings (570 pts), behind Jessie Diggins (876) and Moa Ilar (749)
- **Before 2025-26:** Had never reached a World Cup podium; best previous result was a single top-5 (6th in Ruka)
- **Equipment:** Salomon skis and boots, Swix poles

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Freestyle strength:** Elite — both World Cup victories came in freestyle; she is one of the strongest skaters in the current field
- **Distance preference:** 10km-20km distance specialist; thrives in both interval start and mass start formats
- **Climbing ability:** Exceptional — demonstrated by winning the Tour de Ski Final Climb at Alpe Cermis, one of the most demanding climbs in cross-country skiing
- **Classic strength:** Competent but not her primary weapon; 14th in Toblach 10km Classic and 8th in Ruka 10km Classic show solid classic ability
- **Sprint ability:** Limited — 83rd in Tour de Ski sprint qualification

## Venue History
Simpson-Larsen won the Tour de Ski Final Climb stage at Val di Fiemme (Alpe Cermis) on 4 January 2026. The Tesero venue is in the Val di Fiemme area, making this effectively her home course for the season. She also competed in the Olympic Skiathlon at Milano Cortina (13th) on 7 February 2026. Her familiarity with the Dolomites altitude and terrain is a significant advantage.

## Key Storylines
Simpson-Larsen's breakthrough season has been one of the defining stories of the 2025-26 World Cup. A late bloomer who had never reached a World Cup podium before this season, she exploded onto the scene with consecutive victories at Davos and the Tour de Ski Final Climb. The Val di Fiemme victory carried profound emotional weight: she dedicated it to biathlete Sivert Guttorm Bakken, who died on the Lavaze Pass in the Dolomites on Christmas Eve, saying "I think that Sivert's spirit was with me on that climb." As a seeded starter (BIB 52), she will go off late in this 10km freestyle interval start — the exact format and technique in which she won at Davos. She is arguably the top medal contender in this start group and a genuine threat for the podium.
