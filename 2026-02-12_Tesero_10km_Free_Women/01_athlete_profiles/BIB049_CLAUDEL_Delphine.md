## Personal Life & Background
- **Born:** 23 March 1996, Remiremont, France ([Wikipedia - Delphine Claudel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphine_Claudel))
- **Hometown:** La Bresse / Remiremont area, in the Vosges Mountains of northeastern France -- a well-known hub for Nordic skiing in France ([Salomon Athlete Page](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/athlete/delphine-claudel))
- **Club:** La Bressaude Section Ski, affiliated with the La Bresse skiing community ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=184250&type=result))
- **How she started skiing:** Claudel began her sports career in athletics, not skiing. When she was 10 years old, school friends convinced her to try cross-country skiing. She immediately loved the atmosphere, the feeling of being outside, and having fun on skis, so she joined the ski club in her town and never looked back. She told FasterSkier: "I was doing athletics... my friends in La Bresse were doing cross-country skiing only for fun. They asked me to come, and I started to like it." ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2021/05/looking-at-france-a-conversation-with-delphine-claudel/), [Salomon Athlete Page](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/athlete/delphine-claudel))
- **Athletics background:** Her grounding in athletics is frequently cited as contributing to her exceptional climbing and cardiovascular capacity -- qualities that have made her an Alpe Cermis specialist. ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2021/05/looking-at-france-a-conversation-with-delphine-claudel/))
- **Role in French skiing:** During the 2020/21 season, Claudel was the sole member of the A-Team on the women's side representing France, highlighting her status as a pioneer and the leading French woman in cross-country skiing. She became the first French woman ever to win a cross-country World Cup individual race (Val di Fiemme, January 2023). ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2022-23/karlsson-swe-tour-de-ski-champion-as-claudel-fra-gets-first-world-cup-win))
- **Personal life:** Claudel keeps her family details private; specific information about her parents and siblings has not been publicly disclosed. ([Wikipedia - Delphine Claudel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphine_Claudel))
- **Notable quote after Olympic skiathlon (Feb 7, 2026):** "I didn't have the weapons. I couldn't ski, I over-ventilated and I had trouble breathing. But I'm not giving up on anything for the rest of the Games." ([NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-a-complicated-skiathlon-for-delphine-claudel-31st-i-didnt-have-the-weapons-0207/))

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Capable but not her strongest suit — struggled in the classic portion of the Olympic skiathlon (36th at halfway) ([NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-a-complicated-skiathlon-for-delphine-claudel-31st-i-didnt-have-the-weapons-0207/))
- **Freestyle strength:** Her primary strength — World Cup win came in freestyle; 7th in Beijing 30km freestyle; best Alpe Cermis results in freestyle mass start climbs ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2022-23/karlsson-swe-tour-de-ski-champion-as-claudel-fra-gets-first-world-cup-win))
- **Sprint ability:** Some sprint capability but primarily a distance skier
- **Distance preference:** 10km-30km; excels in medium distances with climbing
- **Best format:** Mass start freestyle events, particularly with significant climbing (Alpe Cermis specialist); also strong in skiathlon when fit ([Salomon](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/athlete/delphine-claudel))
- **Climbing ability:** Outstanding at peak fitness — three-time Alpe Cermis podium finisher (3rd 2021, 3rd 2022, 1st 2023, 3rd 2024); the 10km free at Val di Fiemme is her signature venue ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2022-23/karlsson-swe-tour-de-ski-champion-as-claudel-fra-gets-first-world-cup-win))

| 07 Feb 2026 | Olympic Skiathlon | 20km Skiathlon C/F | 31st | +5:00+ |

*Note: Val di Fiemme/Tesero is Claudel's most successful venue. She has won and podiumed at the Tour de Ski Alpe Cermis stage four consecutive years (2021-2024). Her sole World Cup victory was earned here. The 10km freestyle format matches her Alpe Cermis expertise, though the interval start rather than mass start is a different tactical challenge. ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2022-23/karlsson-swe-tour-de-ski-champion-as-claudel-fra-gets-first-world-cup-win), [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/delphine-claudel-is-making-history/))*

## Key Storylines
- **Injury-ravaged build-up:** Claudel's 2025-26 season has been severely disrupted by a bone oedema in her left foot, discovered after the Ruka World Cup (28 Nov 2025). This compounded a stress fracture in her right foot that cost her the entire second half of the 2024-25 season and the 2025 World Championships. She was absent from competition for nearly two months (30 Nov 2025 to 25 Jan 2026). ([NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-delphine-claudel-back-in-the-world-cup-in-goms-the-aches-and-pains-have-all-disappeared-0122/), [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/new-setback-ahead-of-the-olympics-sidelined-indefinitely/))
- **Goms return and Olympic preparation:** She returned to competition at Goms (25 Jan 2026, 32nd) primarily as a test, not seeking a result. She said: "The aches and pains have all disappeared." The goal was to rebuild race fitness before the Olympics. ([NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-delphine-claudel-back-in-the-world-cup-in-goms-the-aches-and-pains-have-all-disappeared-0122/))
- **Difficult Olympic skiathlon:** Finished 31st in the skiathlon on Feb 7, admitting: "I didn't have the weapons. I couldn't ski, I over-ventilated and I had trouble breathing." But she remains motivated: "I'm not giving up on anything for the rest of the Games." ([NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-a-complicated-skiathlon-for-delphine-claudel-31st-i-didnt-have-the-weapons-0207/))
- **Val di Fiemme is her happy place:** Despite her current fitness concerns, the Tesero/Val di Fiemme venue is where Claudel has achieved her greatest career results — four consecutive Alpe Cermis podiums (2021-2024) and her historic World Cup win. Venue familiarity and positive memories could provide a boost. ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2022-23/karlsson-swe-tour-de-ski-champion-as-claudel-fra-gets-first-world-cup-win))
- **French pioneer in XC skiing:** As the first French woman to win a cross-country World Cup race, Claudel carries the flag for French women's distance skiing. Her Beijing results (9th skiathlon, 7th in 30km) showed she can compete at the highest level when healthy. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/delphine-claudel-is-making-history/))
- **Athletics background:** Originally an athletics athlete before switching to cross-country skiing through friends. This background is often cited as contributing to her exceptional climbing and cardiovascular capacity. ([Salomon](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/athlete/delphine-claudel), [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2021/05/looking-at-france-a-conversation-with-delphine-claudel/))
- **Third Olympics:** This is Claudel's third Olympic Games (PyeongChang 2018, Beijing 2022, Milano Cortina 2026). ([NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-a-complicated-skiathlon-for-delphine-claudel-31st-i-didnt-have-the-weapons-0207/))
