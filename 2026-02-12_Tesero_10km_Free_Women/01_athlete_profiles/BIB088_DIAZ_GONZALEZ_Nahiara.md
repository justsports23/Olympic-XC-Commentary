## Personal Life & Background
Diaz Gonzalez was born on 25 January 2004. While her official birthplace is listed as Buenos Aires, she grew up in Caviahue, a small pueblo of about 600 inhabitants in the province of Neuquen in the Andes mountains, near the Chilean border, approximately 360 km from the city of Neuquen ([Neuquen Informa](https://www.neuqueninforma.gob.ar/noticias/2024/09/23/244963-la-neuquina-nahiara-diaz-gonzalez-es-campeona-sudamericana-en-esqui)). She started skiing recreationally at age six with her family and reached her first competition in 2017 through a local school program ([Lacar Digital](https://www.lacardigital.com.ar/la-neuquina-nahiara-diaz-representara-a-la-argentina-en-los-juegos-olimpicos-de-invierno/)). In 2021, she secured a scholarship for a month-and-a-half training stint in Lebanon, a country with a cross-country ski racing circuit used by Latin American skiers seeking Olympic qualification; she won all five races she competed in there, which proved to be the final push toward her Beijing 2022 Olympic qualification ([Subrayado](https://www.subrayado.com.uy/nahiara-diaz-caviahue-pekin-n835867)). She is a beneficiary of the province of Neuquen's "Asistencia al Mediano y Alto Rendimiento" athletic scholarship program ([Neuquen Informa](https://www.neuqueninforma.gob.ar/noticias/2024/09/23/244963-la-neuquina-nahiara-diaz-gonzalez-es-campeona-sudamericana-en-esqui)). She has been the leader of the South American Cup circuit for the past three years and won both the 5km and sprint titles at the 2023 South American Cup in Bariloche ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/south-american-cup-2023-first-weekend-recap/)).
