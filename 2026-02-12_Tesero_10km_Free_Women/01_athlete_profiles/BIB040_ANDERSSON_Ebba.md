## Personal Life & Background

### Hometown & Upbringing
Ebba Kristina Andersson was born on 10 July 1997 in Delsbo, Sweden, and moved to Solleftea with her family when she was three years old. Solleftea sits along the Angermanalven river in the Vasternorrland region, a quiet town of fewer than eight thousand residents with a strong skiing culture. It was her father, Per-Ola Andersson, who guided young Ebba into cross-country skiing when he moved the family to Solleftea to take over a job as a coach at the local Skidgymnasium (ski high school). ([ebba-andersson.se](https://www.ebba-andersson.se/en/om-mig/)) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebba_Andersson_(cross-country_skier)))

### Family & Father as Coach
Ebba's father Per-Ola Andersson has been her personal coach for much of her career. Even when she joined the Swedish national team in 2017, her father remained her personal coach and followed her closely when the Swedish skiers were not involved in national training camps. Before the 2026 Olympics, she skipped all World Cup racing after January 4 to train at her parents' home in Solleftea -- an unconventional approach that her father oversaw, and one that paid off with Olympic silver. She has spoken about the value of returning home: she wants *"peace and quiet and security"* and finds it positive to relax alongside training in her home environment with her parents. ([Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/the-medal-hopes-load-up-with-parents-peace-and-quiet)) ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/andersson-leads-swedish-party-in-skiathlon-at-milano-cortina))

### How She Started Skiing
When she was a little kid, her parents took her out in the ski tracks. *"It wasn't until she was around 8 years old that she found the interest in skiing by herself,"* after hearing about programs that the local ski club Solleftea Skidor had for kids. She thought it was exciting to train with them, and from that time, cross-country skiing has been a big part of her life. ([ebba-andersson.se](https://www.ebba-andersson.se/en/om-mig/))

### Athletic Versatility -- Running Background
Like many of the best cross-country skiers, Andersson has an impressive running background. During high school, she competed in middle-distance track and field, earning medals and Swedish junior titles in both the 3000m and 1500m. At the 2015 European Junior Championships in Eskilstuna, she finished 6th in the 3000m with a time of 9:29.98, competing for Solleftea GIF Friidrott. There was even debate between Swedish Athletics and the Swedish Ski Federation about which sport should receive Ebba's primary focus. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebba_Andersson_(cross-country_skier)))

### Relationship
Andersson is in a relationship with skier Gustaf Berglund. The couple has been together since roughly 2021 -- it all started when Gustaf invited Ebba over for milk and cinnamon buns, and afterward they went for a walk together. In the fall of 2024, they moved into a new house together. She has described being *"proud of the life I have at home with my boyfriend, friends, family and a new house to live in."* ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/andersson-found-comfort-in-her-boyfriend-he-is-my-safe-haven-in-life/)) ([Fischer Sports](https://www.fischersports.com/athlete/ebba-andersson))

### Current Residence
She currently resides in Ostersund, Sweden, and represents the club Pitea Elit SK. ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=190104&type=result))

### Personality, Hobbies & Interests
Andersson describes herself as a "foodie" and her personal motto is: *"Fake it til you make it!"* Beyond skiing, she values time with family, her boyfriend, and friends. She has emphasized the importance of having interests outside the sport: it *"shouldn't just be eating, training, sleeping"* -- stepping out of the skiing bubble has been key to keeping her focus. She was one of Sweden's summer radio hosts and released a book in April 2024. ([ebba-andersson.se](https://www.ebba-andersson.se/en/om-mig/)) ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-i-have-to-do-other-things-to-continue-to-enjoy-the-sport-ebba-andersson-explains-the-keys-to-her-success-0602/))

### Health Openness
Andersson has spoken openly about losing her menstrual period during her competitive career -- a common issue among elite female endurance athletes -- and has taken steps to address it, including bringing her own chef to the Olympics to ensure proper nutrition. ([Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/ebba-andersson-lost-her-period-and-won-an-olympic-medal-gets-her-own-chef-for-the-olympics))

**Season narrative:** Andersson skipped all World Cup racing after January 4 (Tour de Ski conclusion), opting instead to train with her father at her parents' home in Solleftea in the weeks before the Olympics. Despite this unconventional preparation, she expressed confidence: "I feel at least as confident (as last year) in the preparations I have made and my current status."

### Other Achievements

- **National titles:** Multiple Swedish championship titles [UNVERIFIED exact count]
- **Athletics background:** Competed at 2015 European Junior Championships in 3000m (6th, 9:29.98) for Solleftea GIF Friidrott ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebba_Andersson_(cross-country_skier)))

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Elite — World champion in 10km Classic (Trondheim 2025), multiple World Cup wins in classic technique. Dominant in classic pacing. ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-fourth-gold-10km-classic-podium))
- **Freestyle strength:** Elite — Won 10km Interval Start Free at Trondheim WC (Dec 2025, 26:05.3). Won Olympic silver in skiathlon which included a 10km freestyle leg. Strong skate technique that complements her endurance base. ([NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/ebba-andersson-earns-first-world-cup-victory-season-10km-free-jessie-diggins-clinches-3rd))
- **Sprint ability:** Weak — Failed to qualify for sprint at Tour de Ski 2025-26 (64th in qualification). Has acknowledged: "For me to [win Tour de Ski], I need to improve my sprinting." ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/ebba-anderssons-tour-de-ski-a-battle-of-body-and-mind/))
- **Distance preference:** Long distance / all-around distance specialist (10km through 50km). Particularly dominant at 10km and skiathlon formats.
- **Best format:** Interval start (7 of 9 WC wins at 10km distance) and skiathlon (2x World Champion). Strong in time-trial pacing, can also control mass starts from the front.
- **Climbing ability:** Excellent — Known as one of the best climbers on the final climb at Alpe Cermis (Tour de Ski). Multiple top-5 Tour de Ski overall finishes built on climbing strength. At the Ruka 20km mass start, she "drove to the front on the final hill, determined to exhaust Karlsson and separate herself from the sprinters." ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/11/sundling-sprints-to-20-k-victory-diggins-second/))
- **Racing style:** Front-runner and pace-setter. Prefers to race from the front, applying steady pressure. Less effective in mass start sprint finishes where tactical speed is needed.

Andersson has significant experience at the Tesero/Val di Fiemme venue through multiple Tour de Ski editions and the recent Olympic skiathlon. The course is familiar terrain for her. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-tesero-cross-country-skiing-stadium-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-val-di-fiemme-stadium-which-will-host-the-cross-country-skiing-events-at-the-milan-cortina-2026-olympics-0103/))

## Key Storylines

### First Individual Olympic Medal
Andersson's skiathlon silver on Feb 7 was her first-ever individual Olympic medal after three Games. Before Milano Cortina, she had stated: "I don't have an individual Olympic medal yet, so that is something I really want to bring home from Italy." ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/andersson-leads-swedish-party-in-skiathlon-at-milano-cortina)) She delivered on that ambition with silver, and will now be hungry for gold in the 10km.

### The Medal Incident
In a memorable post-race moment, Andersson's silver medal broke apart shortly after the ceremony, with pieces scattered in the snow. She described the incident with humor: "There are still pieces of it lying around in the snow." ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-there-are-still-pieces-of-it-lying-around-in-the-snow-the-misadventure-of-ebba-andersson-second-in-the-skiathlon-with-her-medal-0207/))

### Unconventional Olympic Preparation
Andersson skipped all World Cup racing from January 4 onwards to train at her parents' home alongside her father, an approach she also used successfully before the 2025 Trondheim World Championships (where she won 3 golds). Despite missing competitive racing for over a month, her skiathlon silver proved this method works for her. ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/andersson-leads-swedish-party-in-skiathlon-at-milano-cortina))

### Rivalry with Frida Karlsson
Karlsson and Andersson are the two pillars of Swedish women's cross-country skiing. Karlsson beat Andersson by 51 seconds in the skiathlon, a significant gap. The 10km free is another chance for Andersson to challenge her teammate. Their rivalry pushes both athletes to higher levels. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-skiathlon-gold-and-silver-at-milano-cortina-2026/))

### COVID Recovery Arc
Andersson's 2023-24 season was disrupted by COVID-19 complications (forced Tour de Ski withdrawal). She returned to claim a World Cup win at Falun in Feb 2025, saying: "It's been a struggle." She then went on to dominate the 2025 Worlds with 3 golds. ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/andersson-kicks-back-from-covid-complications-to-claim-first-win-since-2023-it-s-been-a-struggle-))

### Health & Personal
Andersson has spoken openly about losing her menstrual period during her competitive career — a common issue among elite female endurance athletes — and has taken steps to address it, including bringing her own chef to the Olympics. ([Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/ebba-andersson-lost-her-period-and-won-an-olympic-medal-gets-her-own-chef-for-the-olympics))

### Race Outlook for 10km Free
The 10km interval start free format is arguably Andersson's strongest format — seven of her nine World Cup wins have come at 10km distance, and her most recent WC win (Dec 7, 2025) was a 10km interval start free. She is the reigning 10km World Champion (classic, Trondheim 2025). The interval start format removes the sprint-finish weakness that can cost her in mass starts. She arrives in strong form after the skiathlon silver and should be among the top favorites.
