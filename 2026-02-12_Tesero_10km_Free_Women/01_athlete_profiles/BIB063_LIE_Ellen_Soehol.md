## Personal Life & Background
Ellen Soehol Lie was born on August 23, 1994, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, but was raised in Norway and currently resides in Lillehammer ([OWIA](https://www.owia.org/ellen-soslashhol-lie.html)). Her dual Australian-Norwegian background gives her a unique pathway in the sport. She grew up skiing in Norway but stepped away from the sport as a teenager, believing other pursuits were more exciting ([OWIA](https://www.owia.org/ellen-soslashhol-lie.html)). In 2018, at age 23, she fully recommitted to her skiing career with the goal of qualifying for an international championship ([OWIA](https://www.owia.org/ellen-soslashhol-lie.html)). After five years of hard work, she achieved that dream by racing at the 2023 World Championships in Planica, Slovenia ([OWIA](https://www.owia.org/ellen-soslashhol-lie.html)).

She is coached by Oystein "Polsa" Pettersen, a former Norwegian cross-country skier who won Olympic gold in the team sprint at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics alongside Petter Northug ([Swix Ambassador Feature](https://swixsport.com/eu/article/ambassadors/ellen-lie)). About working with Pettersen, Lie has said: "Honestly, it's insanely awesome! You'd have difficulty finding someone more engaged, joyful, interested, and genuine" ([Swix Ambassador Feature](https://swixsport.com/eu/article/ambassadors/ellen-lie)). She commenced her Olympic Winter Institute of Australia (OWIA) Athlete Performance Contract in 2024 ([OWIA](https://www.owia.org/ellen-soslashhol-lie.html)).

On skiing in Australia, Lie has noted: "Many people are surprised, but there's snow and skiing in Australia, mainly at Falls Creek and Perisher. It can be incredibly beautiful there, but also quite harsh in terms of weather. We are a small but tight-knit group who work together to elevate Australia as a skiing nation" ([OWIA](https://www.owia.org/ellen-soslashhol-lie.html)). Her biggest personal goal is to "complete key training sessions with the highest quality, always aiming to improve" ([OWIA](https://www.owia.org/ellen-soslashhol-lie.html)).
