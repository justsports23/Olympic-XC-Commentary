## Venue History

Fink raced the Olympic skiathlon at Tesero on 7 February, finishing 12th. She DNS'd the Tour de Ski final stage at Val di Fiemme (nearby venue) earlier in the season. Her 12th place at the skiathlon was Germany's best result in the race. ([GEA](https://www.gea.de/sport_artikel,-olympia-pia-fink-aus-m%C3%BCnsingen-im-skiathlonbeste-deutsche-_arid,7122862.html)) ([Olympics.com - Milano Cortina 2026 Skiathlon Results](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/ccs/ms/w/skiathln----------/fnl-/000100--/race-result))

## Key Storylines
- **Best German result in Olympic skiathlon since 2010:** Fink's 12th place in the skiathlon at Tesero was the best DSV result in an Olympic skiathlon since Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle's 11th place in Vancouver 2010. She improved from 13th at the halfway mark to 12th by the finish, demonstrating a strong skating half. ([GEA](https://www.gea.de/sport_artikel,-olympia-pia-fink-aus-m%C3%BCnsingen-im-skiathlonbeste-deutsche-_arid,7122862.html))
- **Reliable relay performer for Germany:** Has been part of Germany's medal-winning relay teams at both the 2023 Worlds (silver) and 2025 Worlds (bronze), cementing her role as a key member of the German distance team. ([ProXCskiing - Planica relay](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/norway-wins-the-womens-relay-at-the-world-championships-in-planica/))
- **Late-career breakthrough:** At 30 years old, Fink is experiencing the best form of her career. Her dramatic improvement from 38th to 15th in overall World Cup rankings between the 2023-24 and 2024-25 seasons shows a skier who has steadily built toward her peak at the right time -- an Olympic season.
- **Consistent but not yet a podium threat individually:** While she regularly finishes in the top 10-15 range on the World Cup, she has not yet achieved an individual podium. A strong result in the 10km Free at the Olympics could be her career-defining moment.
- **From the Schwabische Alb:** Born in Munsingen in the Swabian Alps of Baden-Wurttemberg, not a traditional stronghold of German cross-country skiing (unlike Thuringia or Saxony). Her club SV Bremelau is a small local club. ([SV Bremelau - Pia Fink](https://www.svbremelau.de/abteilungen/ski-und-breitensport/pia-fink/))
- **Second Olympics:** Having gained experience at Beijing 2022, where results were modest, Fink comes to these Games as a much-improved and confident skier.
