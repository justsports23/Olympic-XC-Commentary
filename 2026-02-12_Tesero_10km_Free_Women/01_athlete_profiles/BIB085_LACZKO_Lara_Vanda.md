## Personal Life & Background
Laczko was born on 28 May 2006 in Bekescsaba, Hungary ([Hungarian Wikipedia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laczk%C3%B3_Lara_Vanda)). Her family moved to Miercurea Ciuc (Csikszereda) in Romania in 2011, where she practiced figure skating for ten years ([Hungarian Wikipedia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laczk%C3%B3_Lara_Vanda)). After returning to Hungary, she transitioned to cross-country skiing and began competing in the sport only in 2023 ([Hungarian Wikipedia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laczk%C3%B3_Lara_Vanda)). Her rapid rise from figure skating to Olympic-level cross-country skiing qualification in just two years is a remarkable athletic transition story. She also has a profile registered with the International Biathlon Union, suggesting involvement in biathlon as well ([IBU Profile](https://www.biathlonworld.com/athlete/laczko-lara-vanda/BTHUN22805200601)). At 19 years old, Laczko is one of the youngest competitors in the Olympic cross-country field ([Hungary Today](https://hungarytoday.hu/our-2026-winter-olympic-contenders-revealed/)).
