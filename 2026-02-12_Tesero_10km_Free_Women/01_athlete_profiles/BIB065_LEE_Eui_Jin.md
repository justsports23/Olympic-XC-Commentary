## Personal Life & Background
Lee Eui Jin (Korean: 이의진) was born in 2001 and competes for the Busan Sports Council ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/eui-jin-lee)). She is a graduate of Gangwon Sports High School ([NamuWiki](https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EC%9D%B4%EC%9D%98%EC%A7%84)).

Lee's introduction to cross-country skiing came in elementary school when she took up the sport at the recommendation of her father's friend. She showed immediate promise, winning a gold medal and a silver medal at the National Winter Sports Festival in 2012 while still in 5th grade ([NamuWiki](https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EC%9D%B4%EC%9D%98%EC%A7%84)). In middle school, she trained through mountain running and marathon to develop her endurance, and went on to win three gold medals at the 2013 National Winter Sports Festival and four golds the following year ([NamuWiki](https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EC%9D%B4%EC%9D%98%EC%A7%84)).

However, Lee fell into a competitive slump and left cross-country skiing entirely for track and field. A subsequent injury prevented her from training properly in athletics, and at the recommendation of a friend, she returned to cross-country skiing during the second semester of her third year of high school ([NamuWiki](https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EC%9D%B4%EC%9D%98%EC%A7%84)).

Lee has a tattoo that reads "Always love what you do," and before each competition she always prays in her heart: "Let's do it while loving what we are doing" ([NamuWiki](https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EC%9D%B4%EC%9D%98%EC%A7%84)). At Beijing 2022, her first Olympics, she placed 77th in the sprint preliminaries and 72nd out of 98 in the women's 10km classic with a time of 34:07.9 ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/eui-jin-lee)).

## Key Storylines
**MAJOR:** Lee and teammate Han Dasom were disqualified from the sprint classic qualification on Feb 10, 2026, after their skis tested positive for fluorinated wax (banned by FIS since the 2023-24 season). Their results were nullified. The Korea Ski and Snowboard Association disputed the findings, claiming the product used was not fluorine wax and that previous international competitions yielded negative test results. It remains unclear whether Lee will be permitted to start the 10km free event on Feb 12. Lee has an unusual career trajectory -- she was a youth prodigy who won multiple national titles in elementary and middle school, experienced a slump, switched to track and field, suffered an injury, then returned to cross-country skiing in high school.
