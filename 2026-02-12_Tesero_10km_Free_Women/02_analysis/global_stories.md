## The Headline Rivalries

### Karlsson vs. Diggins: The Defining Duel of the Olympic Distance Programme

Five days ago, Frida Karlsson broke away with 5km remaining in the Olympic skiathlon and cruised to gold by 51 seconds. Jessie Diggins, the World Cup overall leader, fell behind a crash and finished 8th. The 10km interval start free -- Diggins' signature format -- is where this rivalry gets its real test. There are no pack tactics, no crashes to get caught behind. Just the clock and 10 kilometres of Val di Fiemme snow.

Karlsson told HBO Max after the skiathlon: *"I felt like a machine. I've never enjoyed skiing as much as I did today."* ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-i-felt-like-a-machine-says-olympic-champion-frida-karlsson-0207/))

Diggins, pursuing her 4th consecutive Overall Crystal Globe -- unprecedented in women's XC history -- will have BIB 44, meaning she will know every split time from the entire field before she starts. She is the reigning 10km freestyle world champion (2023) and the three-time Tour de Ski champion. This format rewards pure fitness and pacing intelligence -- exactly where Diggins has built her legend. ([Team USA](https://www.teamusa.com/news/2026/february/01/olympic-winter-games-milano-cortina-2026-preview-cross-country-skiing))

An individual Olympic gold is the one missing piece in the most decorated career in American cross-country skiing history. This is Diggins' fourth and final Olympics.

### The Swedish Three-Headed Monster

Sweden is in a golden era. At the 2025 Trondheim World Championships, the Swedish women swept gold medals. Linn Svahn led a podium sweep in the Olympic sprint classic just two days ago. Now Frida Karlsson (skiathlon gold), Ebba Andersson (skiathlon silver, 10km World Cup winner at Trondheim in December), and Moa Ilar (2nd in the World Cup overall standings, 2nd in World Cup distance standings) all line up as medal threats.

Andersson won the 10km free interval start at the Trondheim World Cup on December 7, 2025 -- the exact format of today's race. Seven of her nine career World Cup victories have come at the 10km distance. Her skiathlon silver medal broke apart after the ceremony, with pieces scattered in the snow. She described the incident with humour: *"There are still pieces of it lying around in the snow."* ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-there-are-still-pieces-of-it-lying-around-in-the-snow-the-misadventure-of-ebba-andersson-second-in-the-skiathlon-with-her-medal-0207/))

Ilar's rise has been one of the stories of the season. Until the summer of 2022, her name was Moa Olsson. She got married, changed her last name, and started climbing the leaderboards. This winter, she has truly broken through, with five podium finishes and a realistic shot at the overall Crystal Globe. No Swedish woman has ever won it. Teammate Ebba Andersson called her season *"incredibly impressive."* ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/a-swedish-breakthrough-rising-star-sends-a-clear-olympic-message/))

### The Norwegian Response

Heidi Weng's bronze in the skiathlon -- her first Olympic medal in 12 years since Sochi 2014 -- reminded everyone that Norway never goes quietly. Weng, Karoline Simpson-Larsen (the World Cup overall contender), and the indefatigable Astrid Oeyre Slind (who finished 6th in the skiathlon at age 37, racing for the private Team Aker Daehlie after rejecting the national team for the third consecutive year) give Norway three legitimate medal threats.

## Comeback & Resilience

### Frida Karlsson: The Foot That Nearly Ended Everything

Karlsson's road to skiathlon gold was paved with pain. A persistent foot injury plagued her through the 2024-25 and 2025-26 seasons. She missed the 2024-25 World Cup almost entirely, skipped the Davos World Cup in December 2025 due to foot pain, and withdrew from the Tour de Ski final stage in January 2026 with a "slipping heel." She told Expressen: *"Now I'm going to put the skis away and get on the bike for a while, to strengthen my tendons a bit."* ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/frida-karlsson-withdraws-from-tour-de-ski/))

After a targeted rehabilitation period and altitude training in Lavaze -- near the Olympic venue -- the foot held up brilliantly in the skiathlon. Whether it will hold for a second demanding 10km race is the question she confronts today. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-frida-karlsson-postpones-her-return-to-the-slopes-with-a-foot-injury-1025/))

### Bruna Moura: The Most Inspirational Story in the Field

**Warning: this story will make you cry.**

At 17, Moura was a promising mountain biker aiming for the 2016 Rio Olympics when a heart condition requiring surgery ended that career. During cardiac recovery, Brazilian sports officials gifted her roller skiing equipment -- and a new sporting life began.

On January 16, 2022, she received the news she had worked more than a decade for: she made Brazil's Olympic team for Beijing. **Eleven days later**, she was in an Italian hospital. Her van had crashed en route from Switzerland to Munich. **The driver was killed.** Moura survived with fractures in her feet, arm, hips, and shoulder -- because she was sitting in the back seat. She never made it to the Beijing Olympics. ([ESPN](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/33165884/brazilian-skier-bruna-moura-olympics-car-crash-italy))

Then, in 2023-24, as she fought to return to competition, she contracted toxoplasmosis -- a parasitic infection that resulted in **25% loss of vision**.

She returned to snow in November 2024, competed at the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim, and -- despite chronic pain in her feet from crash injuries -- qualified for her first-ever Olympic Games at Milano Cortina 2026.

*"Everything's burning. We ask ourselves, 'Why are we doing this?' Because it's too painful. But at the same time, it's like anger. You really want to do it. You really want to cross the finish line, just like if it's a big challenge. And if you cross the finish line, you are a hero."* ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/bruna-moura-brazil-cross-country-skiing-car-crash-survivor-exclusive/))

She doesn't know if she can continue skiing after these Olympics due to the foot pain. The moment she crosses the finish line -- regardless of time -- will be one of the most emotional images of these Games. ([NBC Sports](https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/bruna-moura-cross-country-skiing-brazil))

### Teresa Stadlober: From Wrong Turn to Right Place

In 2018 at PyeongChang, Stadlober was running 2nd in the 30km classic with 7km to go when she took a wrong turn and finished 9th. It is one of the most heartbreaking moments in Olympic cross-country skiing history. She told reporters at the time: *"I don't know why I took the wrong way."* ([ESPN](http://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/22574076))

She redeemed herself with Olympic skiathlon bronze in Beijing 2022 -- Austria's first-ever female Olympic XC medal. Now at 33, in the form of her life -- Tour de Ski runner-up, 4th in the World Cup overall, career-high prize money of 69,300 CHF -- she arrived at these Olympics fighting a cold that hampered her skiathlon (9th). She indicated the skating portion went well and expressed confidence for the 10km free. ([ORF Sport](https://sport.orf.at/milanocortina2026/stories/3151161/))

### Heidi Weng: Twelve Years Between Olympic Medals

Weng's skiathlon bronze completed one of the great comeback arcs in Norwegian skiing. After a COVID illness cost her the 2022 Olympics and a subsequent concussion, she thought her career was over. She told TV2 she couldn't recognise herself. Twelve years after her first Olympic medal (Sochi 2014 skiathlon bronze), she stepped onto the podium again. On the edge of the Tesero track, her parents could not contain their emotions. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-its-incredible-heidi-weng-wins-olympic-medal-again-twelve-years-on-0207/)) ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/heidi-weng-i-dont-recognize-myself/))

## Pioneers from Non-Traditional Nations

### Karen Chanloung (THA) -- BIB 110: Skiing Siblings Come Home to Italy

Born in Gressoney-La-Trinite in Italy's Aosta Valley to an Italian mother and a Thai father, Karen Chanloung grew up on the very snow she's now racing on in Italian colours -- except she wears Thailand's. She and her brother Mark switched allegiance from Italy to Thailand in 2016, helping build a national federation from scratch. This is their third consecutive Winter Olympics (PyeongChang, Beijing, Milano Cortina). *"This Olympics will be more special because it's in Italy, where we grew up,"* Karen said. Their grandmother Ada will attend in person. Mark also designed the team's race suits. ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/thailand-chanloung-siblings-home-milano-cortina-2026)) ([Olympics.com Athlete365](https://www.olympics.com/athlete365/news/milano-cortina2026/karen-and-mark-chanloung-skiing-siblings-putting-thailand-on-the-map))

### Samaneh Beyrami Baher (IRI) -- BIB 111: An Architect Driving Hours Through Tehran Traffic to Train

The 34-year-old Iranian architect and cross-country skier is the final starter in the field -- BIB 111, starting at 13:55:30. She carried Iran's flag at the PyeongChang 2018 opening ceremony and will carry it again at Milano Cortina alongside Danial Saveh Shemshaki. With no ski resorts in Tehran, she often drives north for two hours in heavy traffic just to reach training tracks. She must be careful about her public image; even harmless photos can have consequences under Iran's strict dress codes. The Iranian Ski Federation monitors her social media. At the 2025 Asian Winter Games in Harbin, she finished 19th in the 5km -- and celebrated as if she had won gold. ([The Ski Saga](https://www.theskisaga.com/cross-country-skiing/iranian-cross-country-skier-samaneh-beyrami-baher-olympic-dreams-and-constraints/)) ([Xinhua](http://english.news.cn/20250209/2aba31ac97cd4161b879892b660d33ee/c.html)) ([Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/523479/Iran-s-flag-bearers-announced-for-2026-Winter-Olympics))

### Jenny Axisa Eriksen (MLT) -- BIB 103: Malta's First-Ever Olympic Cross-Country Skier

At just 20 years old, Axisa Eriksen has written her name into Maltese sporting history. Born in Norway to a Maltese mother and Norwegian father, she secured Malta's first-ever Olympic cross-country skiing quota at the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim. She carried the Maltese flag during the Opening Ceremony at the Predazzo Cluster. Malta -- an island nation in the Mediterranean with no mountains and no snow -- now has an Olympic cross-country skier. ([Maltese Olympic Committee](https://nocmalta.org/malta-to-be-represented-by-cross-country-skier-jenny-axisa-eriksen-at-milano-cortina-2026-winter-olympic-games/)) ([Malta Daily](https://maltadaily.mt/sports/jenny-axisa-eriksen-set-to-make-history-for-malta-at-milano-cortina-2026))

### Regina Martinez Lorenzo (MEX) -- BIB 108: The Emergency Room Doctor Who Skis for Mexico

Born in Mexico City, Martinez Lorenzo discovered cross-country skiing while studying medicine in Minnesota, using it to combat *"the loneliness and lack of light"* of brutal American winters. What began as therapy became a history-making pursuit. Now a certified emergency room doctor at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, she is the first woman ever to represent Mexico in Olympic cross-country skiing -- achieved in just four years of professional training. She trains in sunshine, funds her career through medical shifts and dog-walking side jobs, and was coached by German Madrazo, who famously danced across the finish line at PyeongChang 2018. ([NBC Miami](https://www.nbcmiami.com/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/team-mexico-cross-country-skier-regina-martinez-lorenzo/3734736/)) ([Teton Gravity Research](https://www.tetongravity.com/meet-the-first-mexican-woman-to-qualify-in-olympic-cross-country/)) ([The Star](https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/others/2026/01/21/olympics-mexican-cross-country-skier-martinez-breaks-barriers-on-path-to-games))

### Sophia Tsu Velicer (TPE) -- BIB 31: Taiwan's First Olympic Cross-Country Skier

Born in Michigan to a Taiwanese mother and an American father, the 26-year-old Velicer is the very first athlete to represent Chinese Taipei in Olympic cross-country skiing. Her 86-year-old maternal grandmother is in Italy to watch, telling reporters it is *"really an achievement for a kid to be able to ski to that level."* ([Formosa News](https://english.ftvnews.com.tw/news/2026209W06EA))

### Ariuntungalag Enkhbayar (MGL) -- BIB 74: Mongolia on Snow

The Mongolian cross-country skier carries her nation's long Winter Olympic history (dating back to Innsbruck 1964) in a sport where Mongolia has never broken into the top tier. Mongolia's delegation of three athletes arrived wearing uniforms by Goyol Cashmere that went viral for their beauty -- a reminder that for some nations, the Olympics are as much about cultural pride as athletic performance. ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/noc-profile/mgl)) ([NBC Los Angeles](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/mongolia-olympic-uniforms-milan-goyol-cashmere-viral/3842297/))

### Eduarda Ribera (BRA) -- BIB 109: Brazil's 21-Year-Old Rising Star

Just 21 years old, Ribera made her Olympic debut at Beijing 2022 at age 17. Her brother Cristian Ribera is a Paralympic winter sports star who will compete at the Milano Cortina Paralympic Games. The family from Rondonia has turned winter sports into a family affair. At the 2026 Olympic sprint, she was the top South American athlete (73rd). She and her brother sought psychological support after Beijing, emphasising that *"all athletes need a psychologist and shouldn't wait for something to happen before seeking help."* ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/pt/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/eduarda-ribera-esqui-cross-country-perfil-biografia-resultados-brasileira-jogos-olimpicos-inverno-milano-cortina-2026))

## The AIN Athletes

### Racing Without a Flag: Nepryaeva and Karaliova

Two athletes in this field compete under the teal AIN (Athlètes Individuels Neutres) banner -- the designation assigned by the IOC to approved Russian and Belarusian athletes following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They cannot wear national colours, display their country's flag, or hear their anthem. They were not part of the Parade of Nations at the Opening Ceremony. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Neutral_Athletes_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics)) ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/ioc/milano-cortina-2026-individual-neutral-athletes))

**Dariya Nepryaeva (AIN, Russian passport) -- BIB 29:** The 23-year-old is the younger sister of Natalya Nepryaeva, who won three medals at Beijing 2022 (relay gold, skiathlon silver, team sprint bronze). Dariya was banned from international competition for nearly three years after the FIS imposed a blanket ban on Russian athletes in February 2022. In December 2025, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled the FIS ban discriminatory, clearing her return. She made her World Cup return at Davos on December 13 and was cleared for Olympic participation less than three months before the Games. She placed 17th in the Olympic skiathlon -- a respectable result for someone who lost nearly three years of development. Her FIS Distance Points of 24.87 make her a genuine competitor in this 10km free. ([TIME](https://time.com/7357901/russian-belarusian-athletes-2026-winter-olympics/))

**Hanna Karaliova (AIN, Belarusian passport) -- BIB 53:** The sole Belarusian cross-country skier at these Games, Karaliova was cleared by the Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel (AINERP) and accepted her invitation. Across all sports, 20 AIN athletes (13 Russian, 7 Belarusian) are competing at Milano Cortina 2026. ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/ioc/milano-cortina-2026-individual-neutral-athletes)) ([Pro Football Network](https://www.profootballnetwork.com/olympics/what-is-ain-in-the-olympics-2026/))

The political dimension is unavoidable. Ukrainian skeleton athlete and flag bearer Vladyslav Heraskevych has argued that allowing AIN athletes to compete *"undermines the principle of neutrality,"* citing athletes with links to occupied territories or expressions of support for the war. Russia's ban has no expiration date. ([CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/06/sport/vladyslav-heraskevych-ukraine-russia-winter-olympics))

## Athletes Competing Through Conflict

### Ukraine's Four Cross-Country Skiers

Four Ukrainian women line up in this 10km: **Anastasiia Nikon (BIB 71)**, **Sofiia Shkatula (BIB 77)**, **Daryna Myhal (BIB 78)**, and **Yelizaveta Nopriienko (BIB 81)**. They are part of Ukraine's largest Winter Olympic delegation in 16 years -- 46 athletes across 11 sports -- fielded despite the ongoing disruptions of Russia's full-scale invasion. ([Kyiv Post](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/69643)) ([Visit Ukraine](https://visitukraine.today/blog/7823/the-2026-winter-olympics-are-officially-open-which-sports-will-ukrainians-compete-in))

Ukraine's flag bearer, skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych, told AFP: *"It's a great honour, for me, but also for Ukraine in these times. I believe it's a very strong symbol for Ukraine that we are still standing strong."* His helmet -- featuring images of more than 20 Ukrainian athletes and coaches killed in the war, including figure skater Dmytro Sharpar, hockey player Oleksiy Loginov, and weightlifter Alina Peregudova -- was banned by the IOC under Article 50.2 of the Olympic Charter. ([CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/06/sport/vladyslav-heraskevych-ukraine-russia-winter-olympics)) ([Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/article/winter-olympics-2026-ioc-bans-two-ukrainian-athletes-from-wearing-helmets-focusing-on-war-170104445.html))

The Ukrainian cross-country skiers train and compete while their country is at war. Their FIS points (ranging from 121 to 159) place them in the bottom half of the field, but their presence at these Games is an act of national defiance. When Nikon, Shkatula, Myhal, and Nopriienko push off from the start line, they carry the weight of a country fighting for survival.

## Family Legacies & Dynasties

### The Stadlober Dynasty (AUT)

Teresa Stadlober (BIB 50) is the daughter of **Alois Stadlober**, a five-time Olympian (1984, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1998) and 1999 World relay champion, and **Roswitha Steiner**, an Alpine skiing World Championship silver medallist (1987) and two-time Olympian. Her brother **Luis Stadlober** is her training partner as part of "Team Teresa Stadlober." With two Olympians as parents, access to sport was always easy. This is Teresa's fourth Olympics. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/teresa-stadlober-the-austrian-olympic-medalist/)) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Stadlober))

### The Di Centa Dynasty (ITA)

Martina di Centa (BIB 9) carries one of the most famous names in Italian winter sport. Her aunt **Manuela di Centa** is a seven-time Olympic medallist and IOC Honorary Member. Her father **Giorgio di Centa** is a five-time Olympian who won two gold medals at Turin 2006, including one where aunt Manuela presented his medal on the podium. Martina herself debuted at Beijing 2022 and now races in front of a home crowd in Val di Fiemme. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Di_Centa)) ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/milano-cortina-2026-italy-history-winter-sport))

### The Kaasiku Twins (EST)

Keidy Kaasiku (BIB 2) and Kaidy Kaasiku (BIB 10) are twin sisters from Estonia who began skiing in the first grade under the coaching of Raido Rohi, following their older brother. They live together in Tartu, train together, race together, and share an Instagram account (@kaasiku.twins). At the 2025 FISU Winter World University Games in Turin, they finished 1st and 2nd in the 20km mass start classic. This is their second consecutive Olympics after Beijing 2022. ([ERR](https://news.err.ee/1609585319/estonian-twins-take-top-two-cross-country-ski-race-spots-at-turin-student-games))

### The Niskanen Siblings (FIN)

Kerttu Niskanen (BIB 60) and her younger brother **Iivo Niskanen** form one of cross-country skiing's most decorated sibling pairs. Between them, they have won nine Olympic medals and five World Championship medals. On December 29, 2021, the siblings made history by winning World Cup 10km and 15km events in Lenzerheide on the same day. ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/niskanen-siblings-cross-country-repeat-medals-beijing-2022))

### Karlsson: Skiing in the Blood (SWE)

Frida Karlsson (BIB 42) is the daughter of former cross-country skier Ann-Marie Karlsson. She was a middle-distance runner (1500m, 3000m) before switching to skiing at age 17, bringing an exceptional aerobic engine. She was mentored by Swedish legend Johan Olsson starting in 2018. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Karlsson))

## Veterans' Last Dance

### Jessie Diggins (USA) -- BIB 44: Age 34, Fourth and Final Olympics

Diggins announced her retirement in November 2025. These are her final Olympics. Her last race will be at the Lake Placid World Cup Finals in March 2026. An individual Olympic gold is the one achievement that would cap the most legendary career in American cross-country skiing history. She won her 2013 World Championship Team Sprint gold at this very venue in Val di Fiemme -- full circle for her farewell. ([NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/jessie-diggins-announces-retirement-2026-olympics-will-be-last-cross-country-skier))

### Krista Parmakoski (FIN) -- BIB 28: Age 35, Fifth and Final Olympics

This is Parmakoski's **fifth** Olympic Games -- only the second Finnish cross-country skier to achieve that. She carries 12 championship medals (5 Olympic, 7 World Championship) across a career spanning since 2009. She was named Finland's flag bearer for the Opening Ceremony alongside hockey player Mikko Lehtonen, and said: *"I will carry the Finnish flag with pride. These are the last major competitions of my career and I am deeply grateful to have been given this honour."* Her best result this season was 10th at Ruka -- an emotional farewell to Finnish fans. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-krista-parmakoski-named-finlands-flag-bearer-for-her-last-olympic-games-0202/)) ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-like-jessie-diggins-finlands-krista-parmakoski-will-retire-at-the-end-of-the-season-1127/))

### Heidi Weng (NOR) -- BIB 32: Age 34, Probable Final Olympics

Weng half-heartedly confirmed to TV2 that Milano Cortina will mark the end of her Olympic adventure -- and probably the beginning of the end of her career. She said she cannot imagine a better place to end than Val di Fiemme, where she competed in her first World Championships at the elite level in 2013. Her parents' emotional reaction to her skiathlon bronze told the story better than words. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-is-heidi-weng-set-to-end-her-career-after-the-milan-cortina-olympics-1229/))

### Kerttu Niskanen (FIN) -- BIB 60: Age 37, Fourth Olympics

At 37, Niskanen is likely competing in her final Olympics. She lost Beijing Olympic gold to Therese Johaug by just 0.4 seconds in the 10km classic. Her late-career renaissance has been remarkable -- 11 podiums in two seasons, the Distance Cup in 2022-23, and first freestyle podiums in 2025 at age 36. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerttu_Niskanen))

### Astrid Oeyre Slind (NOR) -- BIB 48: Age 37, Olympic Debut

In one of sport's great ironies, Slind is making her Olympic debut at age 37 -- after rejecting the Norwegian national team for the third consecutive year to race with private Team Aker Daehlie. She secured 13 World Cup podiums this winter, including four victories, and finished as the top Norwegian in the World Cup overall (4th). She finished 6th in the skiathlon. This is her first Olympic Games despite being one of the most consistent performers on the World Cup circuit. A twin sister of Silje Oeyre Slind and older sister of Kari Oeyre Slind, she has proven that Olympic dreams have no age limit.

## Rising Stars & Breakthrough Moments

### Moa Ilar (SWE) -- BIB 46: The Breakthrough Season

Until recently, Ilar was a skilled national team skier but not a household name. This winter, everything changed. She sits 2nd in the World Cup overall standings behind Diggins and has five podium finishes. She won the 10km classic at Oberhof and has beaten Karlsson, Andersson, and Sundling in Olympic events. No Swedish woman has ever won the overall World Cup. Ilar partly credits a break in spring and early summer due to surgery to address a stubborn issue she had struggled with for ten years. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/a-swedish-breakthrough-rising-star-sends-a-clear-olympic-message/)) ([Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/skiddoldis-moa-ilar-chases-historic-title-enjoying-the-moment))

### Karoline Simpson-Larsen (NOR) -- BIB 52: Norway's New Generation

Part of Norway's emerging distance generation, Simpson-Larsen is 3rd in the World Cup distance standings (570 pts) and represents the future of Norwegian women's cross-country skiing as the veterans begin to retire. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/cross-country-world-cup-2025-2026-standings-after-goms/))

### Eduarda Ribera (BRA) -- BIB 109: Olympic Veteran at 21

Making her second Olympic appearance at just 21, Ribera represents the next generation of Brazilian winter sport. Her 2025-26 results show measurable improvement from Beijing 2022, where she was a 17-year-old debutante. Her brother Cristian's Paralympic career adds another dimension to their family's winter sports story.

## Mental Health & Athlete Advocacy

### Jessie Diggins and the *Threshold* Documentary

Diggins is a longtime advocate for destigmatising eating disorders. She publicly disclosed her struggle with bulimia in a June 2018 blog post, then wrote the autobiography *"Brave Enough"* (2020). She is an ambassador for The Emily Program, a treatment centre, describing this advocacy work as *"the most impactful and rewarding experience of my entire career"* -- more meaningful than any gold medal.

What the public did not know until now: during the 2023-24 season, Diggins suffered a relapse so severe that U.S. Ski Team staff was prepared to stop her from racing. A body-composition scan in Norway produced results her coach Jason Cork called *"shocking,"* with too many red flags. Program director Chris Grover said: *"She got very close to the edge."* She continued to struggle not just in the summer and fall but through the winter -- even as she was racking up podium finishes, winning the Tour de Ski, and claiming the overall Crystal Globe.

This previously undisclosed ordeal is the subject of *"Threshold,"* a documentary filmed by the Brinkema brothers with executive producer Patrick Dempsey, premiering on NBC's Peacock on February 23. It contains 15 interviews totalling over 30 hours and 400 hours of footage. Diggins said at a pre-Olympics news conference: *"I'm willing to put my story on the line to help change this. I hope that it inspires people to have really critical conversations that can end up actually saving lives."* ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/the-new-diggins-documentary-is-a-crucible-of-elite-sport-and-mental-health/)) ([US Ski & Snowboard](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/threshold-untold-story-jessie-diggins-premieres-nbcs-peacock-february-23)) ([TIME](https://time.com/7347101/jessie-diggins-olympics-2026-milano-cortina-interview/)) ([The Emily Program](https://emilyprogram.com/blog/jessie-diggins-facing-my-fears-and-finding-recovery/))

### Ebba Andersson on Amenorrhea in Elite Sport

Andersson has spoken openly about losing her menstrual period during her competitive career -- a common but rarely discussed issue among elite female endurance athletes. She has taken concrete steps to address it, including bringing her own chef to the Olympics to ensure proper nutrition and recovery.

## The Host Nation

### Italy's Largest-Ever Winter Olympic Team Races at Home

Italy has fielded 196 athletes -- the largest delegation in the country's Winter Olympic history, surpassing the 184 at Turin 2006. Seven women represent Italy in cross-country skiing: **Caterina Ganz (BIB 38)**, **Anna Comarella (BIB 12)**, **Martina di Centa (BIB 9)**, and **Maria Gismondi (BIB 22)** are all in this 10km field. ([CONI](https://milanocortina2026.coni.it/en/news/italia-team-officially-confirmed-for-milano-cortina-2026-all-time-record-with-196-athletes.html))

Ganz, who made her Olympic debut at Beijing 2022 in empty stadiums due to COVID protocols, acknowledged that Italy's best chances lie in team events but said: *"In the team events, you have more of a possibility that something could happen."* The home crowd will give the Italian women something they have never had at an Olympics: genuine home support on a course many of them know intimately from World Cup and Tour de Ski appearances. ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/italy-s-stars-who-will-have-the-olympic-cross-country-on-their-doorstep-we-will-also-use-the-home-pressure-to-go-faster-))

Simone Dapra, whose home is a mere sprint from the tracks in Val di Fiemme, is determined to make the competition memorable. The Italian cross-country skiing tradition stretches back to Franco Nones' groundbreaking 30km gold at Grenoble 1968 -- the first non-Scandinavian to win Olympic cross-country gold. Nones, born in Val di Fiemme, carried the Olympic flag at the 2026 Opening Ceremony in Cortina.

## Flag Bearers & National Pride

Several athletes in this 10km field carried their nation's flag at the Opening Ceremony on February 6:

| Athlete | NOC | Role |
|---------|-----|------|
| **Krista Parmakoski** (BIB 28) | FIN | Flag bearer alongside Mikko Lehtonen ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-krista-parmakoski-named-finlands-flag-bearer-for-her-last-olympic-games-0202/)) |
| **Anja Ilic** (BIB 91) | SRB | Flag bearer alongside Milos Milosavljevic ([Serbian Times](https://serbiantimes.info/en/ceremonial-opening-of-the-winter-olympic-games-in-italy-anja-ilic-and-milos-milosavljevic-carried-the-flag-of-serbia-video/)) |
| **Samaneh Beyrami Baher** (BIB 111) | IRI | Flag bearer alongside Danial Saveh Shemshaki ([Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/523479/Iran-s-flag-bearers-announced-for-2026-Winter-Olympics)) |
| **Jenny Axisa Eriksen** (BIB 103) | MLT | Flag bearer at the Predazzo Cluster Ceremony ([Maltese Olympic Committee](https://nocmalta.org/malta-to-be-represented-by-cross-country-skier-jenny-axisa-eriksen-at-milano-cortina-2026-winter-olympic-games/)) |

Additionally, Italy's **Federico Pellegrino** (men's cross-country skiing) carried the Italian flag alongside Arianna Fontana. Franco Nones -- the 1968 gold medallist from Val di Fiemme itself -- carried the Olympic flag. ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/all-flagbearers-named-for-milano-cortina-2026-opening-ceremony))

**Anja Ilic's story** deserves special mention: the 27-year-old Serbian represented her country at the World Championships as a teenager in 2015 in Falun. Over a decade later, she makes her Olympic debut. Her FIS database lists her occupation as "school student." She was honoured as Serbia's flag bearer -- reflecting her status as the face of Serbian cross-country skiing in a non-traditional winter sports nation.

## Olympic Firsts

### First Athletes from Their Country in Olympic Cross-Country Skiing

- **Sophia Tsu Velicer (TPE) -- BIB 31:** The first athlete to represent Chinese Taipei in Olympic cross-country skiing. Born in Michigan to a Taiwanese mother and American father, with her 86-year-old grandmother in the stands. ([Formosa News](https://english.ftvnews.com.tw/news/2026209W06EA))

- **Jenny Axisa Eriksen (MLT) -- BIB 103:** Malta's first-ever Olympic cross-country skier, securing the quota at the 2025 Trondheim World Championships. Born in Norway to a Maltese mother and Norwegian father. ([Maltese Olympic Committee](https://nocmalta.org/malta-to-be-represented-by-cross-country-skier-jenny-axisa-eriksen-at-milano-cortina-2026-winter-olympic-games/))

- **Regina Martinez Lorenzo (MEX) -- BIB 108:** The first woman to represent Mexico in Olympic cross-country skiing. An emergency room doctor from Miami who discovered skiing in Minnesota. ([NBC Miami](https://www.nbcmiami.com/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/team-mexico-cross-country-skier-regina-martinez-lorenzo/3734736/))

### First Gender-Equal Olympic Cross-Country Skiing Programme

For the first time in Olympic history, men and women race the same distances in all cross-country skiing events. Both genders now race 10km (not 10km women / 15km men), 20km skiathlon (not 15km women / 30km men), 50km (not 30km women / 50km men), and 7.5km relay legs (not 5km women / 10km men). This historic equalisation at Milano Cortina 2026 closes a gap that has existed since women first competed in Olympic cross-country skiing in 1952. ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/2025/11/25/milano-cortina-2026-set-to-have-first-gender-equal-olympic-racing-programme-for-cross-country-skiing/)) ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/sports/cross-country-skiing))

### Dinigeer Yilamujiang: From the Cauldron to the Course

Dinigeer Yilamujiang (BIB 73) lit the Olympic cauldron at the Beijing 2022 Opening Ceremony as a 20-year-old -- a moment that drew massive international attention and controversy due to her Uyghur ethnicity amid China's treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. She was the first person of Uyghur ethnicity to light the Olympic cauldron. Her selection was immediately viewed as a political statement by Beijing against the diplomatic boycotts declared by the US, UK, Australia, and Canada. She avoided foreign media throughout the Games, exiting venues without passing through the mixed zone. Now 24 and competing at her second Olympics, she has developed as China's leading female cross-country skier, winning medals at the 2025 Asian Winter Games. Born in Altay, Xinjiang -- a region with rock paintings of people hunting on skis estimated to be over 10,000 years old, recognised as one of the earliest origins of skiing -- her story bridges the ancient and the modern in ways no other athlete's can. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/04/1078234213/beijing-olympics-flame-torch-uyghur)) ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2022/02/05/dinigeer-yilamujiang-cauldron-olympic-skiing/))

## Numbers & Records

### 111 Athletes from 46 Nations

This is the largest women's cross-country skiing field at a Winter Olympics. The 46 nations represented span every inhabited continent:

- **Europe:** Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Italy, Poland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Estonia, Slovenia, Great Britain, Andorra, Croatia, Greece, Iceland, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Turkey, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Armenia, Serbia, Malta
- **Asia:** China, Japan, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Iran, Chinese Taipei, Thailand
- **Americas:** USA, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico
- **Oceania:** Australia

The field ranges from Samaneh Beyrami Baher of Iran (FIS Distance Points: 454.93) to multiple seeded athletes with points under 1.00. It encompasses five-time Olympians, Olympic debutantes, a 20-year-old Maltese pioneer, a 37-year-old Norwegian making her first Olympic start, an Iranian architect, a Mexican emergency room doctor, and a Brazilian car crash survivor.

The spread in start times tells the story of the field's diversity: BIB 1 (Melissa Gal, FRA) starts at 13:00:30. BIB 111 (Beyrami Baher, IRI) starts at 13:55:30. Fifty-five minutes separate the first and last starter. By the time Beyrami Baher pushes off, the medal contenders will likely already know their fates.

### Historic Distance Equality

The men's 10km interval start (raced on the same day or adjacent day) uses the exact same distance as the women's for the first time in Olympic history. Previously, men raced 15km. This change, implemented across all cross-country events at Milano Cortina 2026, marks a watershed moment for gender equality in winter sport. ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/2025/11/25/milano-cortina-2026-set-to-have-first-gender-equal-olympic-racing-programme-for-cross-country-skiing/))

### Val di Fiemme: A Venue Steeped in History

The Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium has hosted World Cup racing, Tour de Ski finals (the famous Alpe Cermis climb), and the 1991 and 2003 Nordic World Ski Championships, as well as the 2013 edition at which Diggins won her first World Championship gold. Franco Nones, Italy's first Olympic cross-country gold medallist (Grenoble 1968), was born in Val di Fiemme. His carrying of the Olympic flag at the 2026 Opening Ceremony in Cortina was a deliberate callback to the region's skiing heritage. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-tesero-cross-country-skiing-stadium-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-val-di-fiemme-stadium-which-will-host-the-cross-country-skiing-events-at-the-milan-cortina-2026-olympics-0103/))

## The Emotional Undercurrent

This is a race about much more than 10 kilometres. It is about Jessie Diggins' final chapter and the eating disorder she nearly died from. It is about Frida Karlsson's foot and whether the pain will hold off for one more race. It is about Bruna Moura crossing a finish line she was never supposed to reach. It is about four Ukrainian women skiing while their country burns. It is about a 20-year-old from Malta who has never seen natural snow in her home country. It is about an Iranian architect who drives two hours through Tehran traffic to find a training track. It is about a Mexican doctor who discovered skiing to fight the loneliness of Minnesota winters.

It is about 111 athletes from 46 nations -- the largest and most diverse women's cross-country field in Olympic history -- sharing the same snow, the same course, and the same dream.
