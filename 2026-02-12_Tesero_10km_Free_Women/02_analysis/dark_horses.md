# Dark Horses -- Women's 10km Interval Start Free
**Event:** Milano Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games
**Venue:** Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium, Val di Fiemme, Italy
**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Format:** 10km Interval Start Free (Skating)

---

These athletes are seeded outside the consensus top-8 favorites but possess credible paths to a top-10 or even podium finish based on specific, evidence-backed factors: technique match, venue history, current form trajectory, format suitability, or home-crowd advantage.

---

## 1. Maria Gismondi (ITA) -- BIB 22

### The Case for a Surprise

Gismondi is the single most dangerous dark horse in this field because the race format, technique, venue, and crowd all align in her favor simultaneously.

**Freestyle specialist in a freestyle race.** Her career-best World Cup result -- **6th in the 10km Freestyle Interval Start at Trondheim** (Dec 7, 2025, +0:26.1) -- came in *exactly* this discipline, distance, and format. That was no fluke: she moved from 12th at the halfway mark to 6th, demonstrating the kind of second-half climbing power that wins medals on the Tesero course. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-it-shows-that-all-the-hard-work-is-paying-off-maria-gismondi-the-italian-revelation-at-trondheim-1207/))

**Reigning Italian champion on this exact course.** Gismondi won the **Italian National Championship 10km individual skate at Val di Fiemme** on January 13, 2026 -- racing on the identical Olympic course and beating Martina Di Centa by three-tenths of a second. No other athlete on the start list can claim a national title on this specific course this season. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-val-di-fiemme-the-individual-skate-of-the-italian-championships-for-maria-gismondi-and-davide-graz-0113/))

**Home crowd factor.** She trains in Moena, just minutes from the Tesero stadium, and will have massive local support. The Italian team has explicitly spoken about using "the home pressure to go faster." ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/italy-s-stars-who-will-have-the-olympic-cross-country-on-their-doorstep-we-will-also-use-the-home-pressure-to-go-faster-))

**Why the skiathlon is misleading.** Her 48th-place Olympic skiathlon finish (Feb 7) looks alarming, but the classic component dragged her down -- her FIS Sprint Points of 171.93 and lack of classic pedigree made the skiathlon a poor fit. In a pure freestyle race, the classic weakness disappears entirely. The gap between her 6th at Trondheim (freestyle) and 48th in the skiathlon (half classic) illustrates this perfectly.

**Historic pedigree.** Her Junior World Championship gold at Planica 2024 (20km mass start freestyle) was the first Italian women's junior XC world title in 35 years, since Stefania Belmondo. She holds the U23 green bib from the 2025-26 World Cup. At 21, she is racing without fear. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/italian-maria-gismondi-wins-the-junior-world-championships-mass-start-in-planica/))

### Realistic Ceiling
**Top-8 finish, with an outside chance at the podium.** Her Trondheim 6th was against a full World Cup field. With the adrenaline of a home Olympics, perfect course knowledge from the national championship, and a format that isolates her greatest strength (freestyle), a top-8 is well within reach. If conditions favor her and established favorites falter, top-5 is not out of the question.

### What Would Need to Go Right
- Clean execution of her interval start pacing (she has less experience in this format at the highest level than in mass starts)
- Course conditions similar to what she trained on in Moena all winter
- Channeling the home crowd energy into motivation rather than pressure
- The established favorites (Diggins, Karlsson, Andersson, Niskanen) all racing cleanly -- Gismondi needs imperfect days from the top tier to reach the podium

---

## 2. Leonie Perry (FRA) -- BIB 25

### The Case for a Surprise

Perry's credentials for this specific race are remarkably precise: her career-best result came in *exactly* this discipline, distance, and format.

**Davos breakthrough: 6th in 10km Freestyle Interval Start.** On December 14, 2025, at just 21 years old, Perry finished **6th in the 10km Freestyle Interval Start at Davos** (+0:15.9), where she was 2nd at the first intermediate split and 4th at halfway before fading slightly. She became only the fifth French woman ever to finish top-6 in a World Cup 10km. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-davos-leonie-perry-magnificent-sixth-in-the-individual-skate-first-world-cup-victory-for-karoline-simpson-larsen-1214/))

**Strong Olympic skiathlon showing.** Perry finished **16th in the Olympic skiathlon** on Feb 7, the best result among French women. Crucially, she was 26th at the ski change (classic) but climbed to 16th during the freestyle leg -- a gain of 10 places in freestyle that signals where her real strength lies. She said afterward: "It really gives me confidence for the 10 km skate." ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-it-really-gives-me-confidence-for-the-10-km-skate-sixteenth-in-the-skiathlon-leonie-perry-looks-back-on-her-race-for-nordic-magazine-0207/))

**Breakout season trajectory.** Her FIS Distance Points improved from 59.87 to 34.44 during this season alone. From a career-best 21st last season, she leaped to 6th at Davos and 16th at the Olympics. The trajectory is steeply upward. ([FIS Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=240145))

**Interval start is her format.** Unlike some young athletes who thrive in pack racing but struggle alone against the clock, Perry's best result came in an interval start. She knows how to pace a 10km freestyle time trial.

**Youth as an advantage.** At 21, with nothing to lose at her first Olympics, Perry can race without the weight of expectation. Her post-skiathlon confidence suggests she is in exactly the right mental space.

### Realistic Ceiling
**Top-8 finish.** Her Davos 6th and Olympic skiathlon 16th (with much of that position lost in classic) suggest that in a pure freestyle interval start, she could crack the top-10 again. A top-8 at the Olympics would be a career-defining moment for the young Frenchwoman.

### What Would Need to Go Right
- Reproducing her Davos pacing strategy -- she went out fast (2nd at first split) and needs to sustain that aggression
- Course conditions that suit her freestyle technique (she struggled at the Val di Fiemme Tour de Ski finale, finishing 21st on the Alpe Cermis climb)
- Maintaining the mental confidence from her skiathlon result without overreaching
- Avoiding the second-half fade that cost her places at Davos (she dropped from 4th to 6th in the final kilometers)

## 3. Katerina Janatova (CZE) -- BIB 36

### The Case for a Surprise

Janatova arrives at this race on the back of arguably the best result of her career, achieved on this exact course five days ago.

**Olympic skiathlon 7th.** On February 7, Janatova finished **7th in the Olympic skiathlon** -- a stunning result for Czech cross-country skiing. The skiathlon combines classic and freestyle over 7.5km each, and her strong finish demonstrated excellent freestyle capability in the second half of the race. ([FIS Cross-Country Results Database](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/results.html))

**Distance specialist in a distance race.** Unlike the Olympic sprint classic (where she qualified 33rd at Ruka and 42nd at Trondheim this season), the 10km freestyle interval start is Janatova's natural habitat. Her seeded BIB 36 reflects her legitimate standing as a distance competitor.

**Course familiarity from the skiathlon.** Having raced the Tesero course just five days earlier, Janatova knows every climb, descent, and transition intimately. She will have detailed split-time data from her skiathlon to fine-tune her pacing.

**Freestyle strength confirmed.** The freestyle leg of the skiathlon was where she finished strongest to secure 7th, a direct preview for the 10km free.

**Peak form timing.** A 7th-place Olympic result is not a one-off anomaly -- it confirms that Janatova arrived at these Games at the peak of her fitness cycle.

### Realistic Ceiling
**Top-8 finish, potentially matching or bettering her skiathlon result.** If the skiathlon 7th was built on freestyle strength (as the data suggests), then a pure freestyle race could see her maintain or improve that position. A second top-7 finish at a single Olympics would confirm this as a breakout Games for the Czech.

### What Would Need to Go Right
- Maintaining the physical peak that produced the skiathlon 7th (five-day recovery is generally sufficient)
- A clean interval start with aggressive but sustainable pacing
- The freestyle-only format removing any classic weakness that may have been masked by the combined skiathlon format
- Confidence from the skiathlon translating to calm, controlled racing against the clock

## 4. Nadine Faehndrich (SUI) -- BIB 24

### The Case for a Surprise

On paper, a sprint specialist in a distance race should not be a dark horse. But Faehndrich is not an ordinary sprinter.

**Proven endurance beyond sprint distance.** Faehndrich won the **2025 Engadin Ski Marathon** -- a 42km race. If she can win a 42km event, the 10km (the shortest distance race on the Olympic program) is not beyond her reach. The 10km exists in a grey zone between sprint fitness and distance endurance where a world-class sprinter with marathon credentials can be dangerous. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_F%C3%A4hndrich))

**Exceptional venue history.** Faehndrich has won and podiumed at Val di Fiemme in back-to-back years: she won the Tour de Ski classic sprint on this course in January 2025 and finished 2nd (by just 0.44 seconds) in January 2026. No athlete in the field has a better two-year sprint record at this venue. While those were sprint results, they demonstrate comfort and confidence on this terrain. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/nadine-fahndrich-wins-tour-de-ski-sprint-in-val-di-fiemme/))

**Strong freestyle credentials.** Despite being known as a classic specialist, Faehndrich earned a World Cup bronze in freestyle sprint (2025 World Championships) and finished 3rd in the freestyle sprint at Davos this season. Her skating is genuinely elite-level. ([SRF Sport](https://www.srf.ch/sport/milano-cortina-2026/langlauf-sprints-bei-olympia-wie-im-traum-faehndrich-will-unverhoffte-medaillen-chance-nutzen))

**Olympic motivation.** Faehndrich missed the Olympic podium by 4 seconds in the sprint at Beijing 2022 (5th). She has described these Olympics as her chance to deliver her "masterpiece." The 10km free is her additional shot at redemption beyond the sprint events. ([SRF Sport](https://www.srf.ch/sport/milano-cortina-2026/langlauf-sprints-bei-olympia-wie-im-traum-faehndrich-will-unverhoffte-medaillen-chance-nutzen))

**Heart surgery comeback story.** After cardiac surgery in March 2024 for arrhythmia, she returned to racing in two weeks and finished 5th. This resilience and determination are exactly the qualities that produce Olympic surprises. ([Sportlerin Magazin](https://www.sportlerin-magazin.ch/post/nadine-faehndrich))

### Realistic Ceiling
**Top-12, with a top-8 possible on a perfect day.** Her FIS Distance Points (34.69) place her outside the elite distance tier, and she has no 10km distance results to benchmark against. But the 10km is the shortest distance event -- the line between sprint fitness and distance fitness is thinnest here. A top-12 would be a major statement for a sprint specialist.

### What Would Need to Go Right
- Pacing discipline -- sprinters often go out too fast in distance races and pay later
- Her Engadin Marathon endurance base translating to a sustained 25+ minute effort at threshold intensity
- Course conditions favoring technical, punchy skiing over pure aerobic grinding
- The emotional boost of racing at a venue where she has won and podiumed in consecutive years

## 5. Vilma Ryytty (FIN) -- BIB 27

### The Case for a Surprise

The 24-year-old Finn has been building momentum all season and arrives with two strong results at this specific venue within the past five weeks.

**Olympic skiathlon 15th.** Ryytty finished **15th in the Olympic skiathlon** on Feb 7 (57:37.3, +3:52.1), a career-best result at the highest level and a strong Olympic debut. This confirms she is in excellent form and comfortable on the Tesero course. ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/ccs/ms/w/skiathln----------/fnl-/000100--/race-result))

**12th at Val di Fiemme Tour de Ski finale.** Her **12th place in the 10km freestyle mass start** at the Tour de Ski Val di Fiemme stage (Jan 4, 2026) is her best World Cup-level result of the season -- and it came at this venue, in this technique. ([FIS Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=222227&type=result))

**Freestyle is her strongest technique.** Her best results consistently come in freestyle: 12th at Val di Fiemme (free), 16th at Trondheim 10km free, and her FIS Distance Points (30.10) are driven primarily by freestyle performances.

**Rapid upward trajectory.** From U23 Worlds 21st (Planica 2024) to Finnish Championship skiathlon winner (Jan 2025) to Olympic top-15 in the skiathlon -- Ryytty's progression has been steep and consistent. She is an athlete still on the upswing. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-imatra-vilma-ryytty-wins-the-skiathlon-at-the-finnish-championships-0112/))

**Venue confidence.** Having raced twice at Tesero/Val di Fiemme this season (Tour de Ski and skiathlon), she has more course familiarity than many competitors. Both results were strong, providing a positive psychological foundation.

### Realistic Ceiling
**Top-12, with an outside chance at top-10.** Her Tour de Ski 12th and Olympic skiathlon 15th define the range. In a pure freestyle race (removing the classic component that dilutes her strength in the skiathlon), she could potentially improve by several positions.

### What Would Need to Go Right
- Bouncing back from her Goms DNF (20km classic, Jan 25) and confirming that the skiathlon 15th was her true current form level
- Strong interval start pacing -- her best results have come in mass start formats, and the individual time trial demands self-regulation
- The 10km distance suiting her better than the 20km+ events where she has also shown strength (her distance range is still being defined)
- Continued form progression rather than a plateau after the skiathlon effort

## Honorable Mentions

### Patricija Eiduka (LAT) -- BIB 18
The Latvian freestyle specialist (career-best 5th in a 20km skating pursuit, 8th in 10km F at Davos in 2020, 15th in 10km F at Davos this season) has the technique profile for a surprise. Her 23rd in the Olympic skiathlon was held back by the classic half. In a pure freestyle race, she could move into the top-15 or higher. Her three Olympic Games of experience (at just 26) and training background with Justyna Kowalczyk give her tools beyond her ranking. ([FIS Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/last-seasons-u-23-winner-patricija-eiduka))

### Emma Ribom (SWE) -- BIB 30
The Swedish sprinter-turned-distance hopeful earned a **Tour de Ski 5km freestyle podium (2nd)** at Toblach and finished 13th in the 10km free at Trondheim this season. She was heartbroken at being omitted from Sweden's Olympic sprint squad and has spoken about this 10km as her chance to show what she can do. The emotional motivation is real, and her freestyle speed is elite. However, illness concerns (Tour de Ski withdrawal, Goms DNF) and health worries (tachycardia episode at 2025 Worlds) temper expectations. ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/seven-new-swedish-cross-country-skiers-confirmed-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/), [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-it-was-a-very-unpleasant-feeling-emma-ribom-looks-back-on-her-tachycardia-episode-at-the-trondheim-worlds-0606/))
