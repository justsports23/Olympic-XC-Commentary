### Competition Structure

The Men's Team Sprint Free follows a two-phase knockout structure ([NBC Olympics format guide](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics); [NBC Olympics competition format](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-competition-format)):

**Phase 1 — Qualification (Interval Start)**
- Teams of two athletes ski an interval-start qualification round; each athlete completes one lap of the 1.585 km sprint course (two laps total per team). ([NBC Olympics format guide](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics))
- The top 15 teams by combined qualification time advance directly to the Final. ([NBC Olympics format guide](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics); [NBC Olympics competition format](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-competition-format))
- Start interval: 30 seconds between teams. ([NBC Olympics format guide](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics))

> Note: Unlike the individual sprint event (which uses quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final), the team sprint goes directly from qualification to a single final heat — there are no semifinals. ([NBC Olympics competition format](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-competition-format))

**Phase 2 — Final**
- One mass-start final heat with **15 teams**. ([NBC Olympics format guide](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics); [NBC Olympics competition format](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-competition-format))
- Each athlete completes three laps (six laps total per team), alternating: Athlete A skis lap 1, Athlete B skis lap 2, Athlete A skis lap 3, and so on, with a tag-touch exchange at the finish line between each leg. ([NBC Olympics format guide](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics))
- The team whose anchor athlete crosses the finish line first wins gold. ([NBC Olympics format guide](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics))
- Results determine full medal and points allocation.

> Note on schedule times: Qualification was scheduled at 09:15 on February 18; the Final at 11:30 (Central European Time). The Women's Team Sprint Free began at 08:45 (qualification) and 10:45 (final). The Men's event therefore started approximately 30 minutes after the Women's qualification on the same day at the same venue.

## Context

- The Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium annually hosts the FIS Cross-Country Ski World Cup and the final stages of the Tour de Ski, making it a highly familiar venue for elite competitors. The venue has also hosted three editions of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships (1991, 2003, 2013). ([NBC Olympics venue guide](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-venue); [Fiemme World Cup — History](https://www.fiemmeworldcup.com/en/organising-committee/the-history))
- The exact Olympic sprint course (1.585 km) was raced during the January 2026 Tour de Ski at Val di Fiemme — athletes had recent direct experience on the Olympic track before arriving for the Games. Note: the Tour de Ski sprint was contested in classic technique, while the Olympic team sprint is freestyle; the physical course layout is the same.

- February 18 was designated "Teams Day" at Milano Cortina 2026, featuring multiple relay and team sprint events across disciplines.
