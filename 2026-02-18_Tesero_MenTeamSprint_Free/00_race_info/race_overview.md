### Competition Structure

The Men's Team Sprint Free follows a two-phase knockout structure ([NBC Olympics format guide](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics)):

**Phase 1 — Qualification (Interval Start)**
- Teams of two athletes ski an interval-start qualification round; each athlete completes one lap of the 1.585 km sprint course (two laps total per team).
- Teams are seeded for the semifinals based on combined qualification time.
- Start interval: 30 seconds between teams.

**Phase 2 — Semifinals (Two heats)**
- Two separate semifinal heats run as mass-start races.
- Each athlete completes three laps (six laps total per team), alternating: Athlete A skis lap 1, Athlete B skis lap 2, Athlete A skis lap 3, and so on, with a tag-touch exchange at the finish line between each leg.
- **Advancement to the Final:** Top 2 finishers from each semifinal advance automatically (4 teams total), plus the next 6 fastest non-qualifying times across both heats ("lucky losers"), for a total of **10 teams in the Final**.

**Phase 3 — Final**
- One mass-start final heat; same alternating-leg format as the semifinals (six laps total per team).
- The team whose anchor athlete crosses the finish line first wins gold.
- Results determine full medal and points allocation.

> Note on schedule times: Qualification was scheduled at 09:15 on February 18; the Final at 11:30 (Central European Time). The Women's Team Sprint Free began at 08:45 (qualification) and 10:45 (final). The Men's event therefore started approximately 30 minutes after the Women's qualification on the same day at the same venue.
