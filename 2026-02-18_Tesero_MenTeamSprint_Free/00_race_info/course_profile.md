## Sprint Course — Olympic Specification

The Men's Team Sprint Free uses the same 1.585 km Olympic sprint course used for the individual sprint events at these Games. The course was also raced during the January 2026 Tour de Ski Val di Fiemme stage, giving athletes a preview of the exact Olympic track ([FasterSkier Tour de Ski sprint](https://fasterskier.com/2026/01/a-sprint-built-for-february-raced-in-january-with-tour-fatigue/)).

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Lap length | 1.585 km (0.985 mi) | [NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics) |
| Total climb (TC) per lap | [DATA NOT FOUND] — exact FIS homologation figure not published in available sources | — |
| Maximum climb (MC) per lap | [DATA NOT FOUND] | — |
| Height difference (HD) per lap | [DATA NOT FOUND] — the wider Lago course is documented at 140 m HD over 3.5 km; sprint-specific figure unavailable | — |
| Venue altitude | ~830–850 m | [NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-venue) |

> Note: The broader Tesero trail network develops from a 3.5 km main loop ("Lago" course) with a height difference of approximately 140 m. Shorter loops ("Paracara" 2.5 km, 100 m HD; "Chiesetta" 2.5 km, 100 m HD) are derived from the main loop. The 1.585 km Olympic sprint course is a purpose-built sub-circuit within this network; its precise TC and MC figures are available in the official FIS homologation documents but were not publicly released in available pre-race coverage.

## Course Character and Notable Sections

Based on reporting from the January 2026 Tour de Ski sprint held on the same course ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/01/a-sprint-built-for-february-raced-in-january-with-tour-fatigue/); [FasterSkier Klaebo wins sprint](https://fasterskier.com/2026/01/klaebo-wins-classic-sprint-in-val-di-fiemme-as-the-tour-de-ski-heads-for-alpe-cermis/)):

- **Defining feature — long sustained climb:** The course is built around one prominent, sustained uphill section. This climb is the race's selective element: athletes who arrive at the base of the climb in poor position or with insufficient power are exposed. The climb offers passing opportunities but demands controlled power output to execute them.
- **Technical descents:** The course features ripping downhills that require precise technique and fast glide. Tactical skiing on the descents is rewarded; errors cost time and position.
- **Tight turns:** Multiple tight turns demand positioning discipline, particularly in the semifinal and final heats where the field is bunched. Corner position is critical to avoid crashes and save energy.
- **Stadium finish:** The course returns to the stadium for the tag exchange and final finish, providing excellent spectator sightlines. The finish straight is a sprint-to-the-line section following the final descent.
- **Overall character:** Longer than a typical sprint course (1.585 km sits at the upper end of the FIS sprint course range), which slightly benefits athletes with more distance-speed crossover and penalizes pure explosive sprinters who struggle to sustain effort across six legs in the final. The course is described as "technical, selective, and honest" — it rewards fitness and decisiveness and punishes hesitation.

## Men's vs. Women's Course

The Men's Team Sprint Free uses the same 1.585 km sprint course as the Women's Team Sprint Free on the same day ([NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics)). There is no separate men's/women's sprint course at Tesero for these Games. Both events share:

- Identical lap length (1.585 km)
- Identical course layout, climbs, and descents
- Same venue and stadium finish

Conditions experienced during the Women's Team Sprint Free (qualification at 08:45, final at ~10:45 CET) will be directly observable before the Men's qualification begins at 09:15.
