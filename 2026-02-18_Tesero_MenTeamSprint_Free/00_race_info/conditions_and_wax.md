# Conditions and Wax — Men's Team Sprint Free

**Date:** February 18, 2026
**Race start (qualification):** 09:15 CET
**Race start (final):** ~11:30 CET
**Venue:** Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium, Val di Fiemme, Italy (~830–850 m elevation)

> Note: The Men's Team Sprint Free shares its race day and course with the Women's Team Sprint Free (qualification 08:45, final ~10:45 CET). Conditions at the start of the men's qualification will be essentially identical to those experienced during the women's qualification 30 minutes earlier. Wax techs who watch the women's races will have direct, real-time data before finalizing men's setups.

### Air Temperature

| Time Window | Temperature (°C) | Conditions |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Overnight / early morning (00:00–06:00) | -9 to -6°C | Clear skies |
| Morning — race window (06:00–12:00) | -9 to -3°C | Clear to partly cloudy; warming through the morning |
| Men's qualification start (~09:15) | approx. -5 to -3°C | [ESTIMATED from morning trend] |
| Men's final (~11:30) | approx. -2 to 0°C | Partly cloudy, warming |
| Afternoon (12:00–18:00) | -2 to 0°C | Partly cloudy |

> Temperature trend: A cold, clear morning with temperatures in the -5 to -3°C range at the time of the men's qualification, warming toward 0°C by the time of the final. This is a notable temperature rise across the ~2.5-hour window from qualification to final — potentially relevant for wax selection.

### Wind

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Morning wind | E / ENE, ~4–7 km/h (light breeze) |
| Afternoon wind shift | Shifting to W / SW, ~4–7 km/h |
| Peak gusts | [DATA NOT FOUND] |

Wind is expected to be light throughout the race window, with a direction shift from easterly to westerly through the day. Impact on racing is expected to be minimal. ([meteocast.net](https://meteocast.net/forecast/it/tesero/))

### Precipitation

- **Race day precipitation:** None expected. ([meteocast.net](https://meteocast.net/forecast/it/tesero/))
- **Overnight precipitation:** Trace amounts possible (0.2 mm noted in overnight forecast) — negligible.
- **Regional outlook:** OpenSnow noted generally quiet weather for this period of the Games, with the lowest precipitation probability at Tesero/Predazzo compared to other Olympic venues. ([OpenSnow Olympics forecast](https://opensnow.com/news/post/milano-cortina-2026-winter-olympics-forecasts))

### Sky / Visibility

- Morning: Clear to partly cloudy
- Race window: Partly cloudy, improving toward afternoon

## Snow Conditions

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Snow base depth (Tesero stadium) | ~23 cm (9 inches) | Reported as of Feb 17, 2026 |
| 24-hour snowfall (to Feb 17) | 0 cm | No fresh snow in the 24 hours preceding the race |
| Season total snowfall | ~13 cm (5 inches) natural | Modest natural snow; venue relies on snowmaking |
| Snow type | Settled/machine-groomed | Artificial snow infrastructure active |
| Snow temperature | [DATA NOT FOUND] — likely in the -3 to -6°C range given air temps, but no official measurement found | |

> The Tesero venue uses an artificial snowmaking system fed by the Avisio river to guarantee track quality. With no natural snowfall in the 24 hours prior to racing and a shallow natural base, the competition surface will be primarily machine-made and machine-groomed. This typically produces a hard, consistent, lower-moisture snow — cold, dry, abrasive characteristics.

## Wax Notes (Freestyle / Skating)

> In freestyle/skating events, no kick wax is used. Wax selection is entirely glide wax for skis and, to a lesser extent, poles. The following notes reflect the expected glide wax environment.

### Expected Glide Wax Conditions

- **Temperature range at race time:** Cold end of the cold-snow spectrum (-3 to -6°C snow temp, estimated). This range typically calls for cold fluorocarbon-free gliders or low-fluoro equivalents.
- **Snow hardness:** Hard, abrasive machine-made snow. Harder snow calls for harder, more durable glide wax structures (fine structure on bases, harder paraffins).
- **Moisture / transformation:** No precipitation, low humidity in the afternoon, moderate humidity in the morning. Snow is expected to be dry and non-transformed — cold/dry conditions rather than wet/spring snow.
- **Warming trend risk:** Air temperature rise from ~-5°C at qualification to ~0°C at the final introduces the possibility of marginally softer snow conditions by the time the men's final is held. Teams should account for this potential transformation when selecting gliders for the final versus qualification.
- **Structure:** Expect fine or medium linear structure appropriate for cold, dry, hard machine snow. Cross structure may be considered if transformation accelerates by late morning.

> [DATA NOT FOUND] — No official FIS wax service bulletins, team technician reports, or competition jury wax notes were publicly available for this event at the time of writing. Wax recommendations above are inferred from conditions data and general principles; they should be treated as preliminary guidance only.

## Comparison: Women's vs. Men's Event Conditions

Since the women's events precede the men's by ~30 minutes (qualification) and ~45 minutes (final), the following adjustments are expected:

| Variable | Women's Event | Men's Event (expected) |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Air temp at qualification | ~-6 to -5°C | ~-5 to -3°C (slightly warmer) |
| Air temp at final | ~-3 to -1°C | ~-2 to 0°C (slightly warmer) |
| Snow hardness | Cold, hard | Marginally softer by men's final |
| Track condition | Fresh grooming | Minor wear from women's heats, but sprint course traffic is limited |
| Wind | Light E | Light, possible shift toward W |

## Historical February Climate Context

For reference: typical mid-February conditions at Tesero/Val di Fiemme historically show average highs around +1 to +3°C and average lows around -5 to -8°C at valley floor level (~830 m). February 18, 2026, appears consistent with or slightly colder than the long-term average, with clear skies rather than overcast conditions.
