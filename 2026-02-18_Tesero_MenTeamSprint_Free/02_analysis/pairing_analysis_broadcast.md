# Men's Team Sprint Free — Pairing Analysis for Broadcasters
## Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics | Tesero, 18 February 2026

---

## How to Use This Document

This is a team-by-team pairing analysis designed for live broadcast commentary. Each entry covers: the logic behind the pairing, what each athlete brings, the complementary dynamic, historical pedigree, and a broadcaster-ready storyline hook. Teams are ordered by medal probability.

**Format note:** The men's team sprint uses a different structure from the women's event. Qualification round (interval start, two laps per team) feeds into two **semifinals** (mass start, six laps each). Top 2 from each semi plus 6 fastest losers advance to a 10-team **Final** (mass start, six laps). Red bib = Leg 1 (Laps 1, 3, 5); Blue bib = Leg 2/Anchor (Laps 2, 4, 6).

## TIER 1: OVERWHELMING FAVORITE

### BIB 01 — NORWAY: Einar Hedegart (Red) / Johannes Hosflot Klaebo (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
This may be the most formidable team sprint pairing ever assembled in men's cross-country skiing. Klaebo is the [greatest cross-country skier in history](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-becomes-most-decorated-cross-country-skier-of-all-time) — [9 Olympic gold medals](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/47936580/johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-wins-9th-olympic-gold-medal-cross-country-skiing) (all-time Winter Olympics record), [15 World Championship golds](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/from-trondheim-trails-to-the-olympic-all-time-throne-klaebo-s-journey-to-greatness), [116 World Cup wins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_H%C3%B8sflot_Kl%C3%A6bo). He is hunting his 10th Olympic gold and 5th medal at these Games. His partner Hedegart is arguably the most remarkable story of the 2026 Olympics: a [former biathlete who switched to cross-country in November 2025](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/einar-hedegart-has-only-been-a-cross-country-skier-since-november-on-friday-he-could-dethrone-the-sports-olympic-king/) and immediately won three of six World Cup races — beating Klaebo himself in every pre-Olympic freestyle event.

**What Hedegart Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- [3 World Cup wins in his debut cross-country season](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/a-star-is-born-hedegart-beats-norway-s-best-for-first-world-cup-win) — beat Klaebo at Beitostolen, Davos, and Trondheim in 10km freestyle
- [Olympic bronze in 10km free at this venue](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42239); [Olympic relay gold at this venue on February 15](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42239)
- Former biathlon World Junior medallist (3 medals) — decade of biathlon training provides extraordinary aerobic base
- Age 24 — explosive power from biathlon shooting-to-skiing transitions translates to team sprint recovery between laps
- Role: Hedegart opens with power. His sustained aerobic engine from biathlon training means he can maintain near-maximal pace across all three of his laps without the degradation that many pure sprinters experience

**What Klaebo Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- [9 Olympic gold medals — all-time Winter Olympics record](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/cross-country-skiing/norwegian-klaebo-ties-all-time-winter-olympics-gold-record-9.7088128); surpassed Bjorn Dahlie
- [Won Olympic sprint freestyle gold at this exact venue](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42284) on February 10 in 3:39.74; [Olympic skiathlon gold](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42284); [Olympic 10km gold](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/johannes-hosflot-kl%C3%A6bo-equals-winter-olympic-record-eight-golds-cross-country-skiing-mens-10km-milano-cortina-2026/); [Olympic relay gold](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42284) — 4 golds already at these Games
- 2x Olympic team sprint gold (2018 PyeongChang); 4x World Championship team sprint gold (2019, 2021, 2023, 2025)
- Role: The greatest closer in the history of the sport. Klaebo's devastating surge on the final climb has ended every team sprint he has contested since 2018

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
This pairing is almost unfair. Hedegart's raw power means he can open at a pace that only the very best Leg 1 athletes can match — and then deliver Klaebo into the anchor legs with a lead or at worst level positioning. Klaebo does the rest. There is a notable quote from Hedegart after Klaebo beat him at the Olympic 10km: ["It's the first time he's beaten me"](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-einar-hedegart-stumbles-on-klaeb-its-the-first-time-hes-beaten-me-0213/) — illustrating that even Klaebo's partner outpaced him for months.

**Championship Team Sprint Record (Klaebo):**
| Year | Event | Partner | Technique | Result |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 2018 | Olympics, PyeongChang | Nystoel | Free | Gold |
| 2019 | World Championships, Seefeld | Valnes | Free | Gold |
| 2021 | World Championships, Oberstdorf | Valnes | Free | Gold |
| 2022 | Olympics, Beijing | Valnes | Free | Silver |
| 2023 | World Championships, Planica | Valnes | Free | Gold |
| 2025 | World Championships, Trondheim | Valnes | Free | Gold |

**Note:** Klaebo's previous team sprint partner was Erik Valnes. The switch to Hedegart represents a new partnership for 2026, but Klaebo elevates whoever races alongside him.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Johannes Klaebo is hunting his 10th Olympic gold medal — which would make him the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time by golds. His partner Einar Hedegart was a biathlete three months ago. Hedegart has beaten Klaebo in every freestyle race this season — until the Olympic 10km. Now they're on the same team. This is the greatest team sprint pairing ever assembled, and it isn't close."*

## TIER 2: MEDAL CONTENDERS

### BIB 03 — ITALY: Elia Barp (Red) / Federico Pellegrino (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Italy pairs its future with its past. Pellegrino (35) is the [most decorated Italian cross-country skier in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Pellegrino) — [62 World Cup podiums, 21 wins, 2 Sprint Crystal Globes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Pellegrino), [4 Olympic medals](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/exclusive-federico-pellegrino-cross-country-ski-mico-2026-ultimate-goal) (2018 silver, 2022 silver, 2026 bronze x2). Barp (23) is the [emerging sprint talent ranked approximately 8th in World Cup Overall](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-italy-unveils-its-sprint-skate-team-with-a-royal-mens-duo-0216/) this season. Italian media have called this pairing ["il duo reale" — the royal duo](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-italy-unveils-its-sprint-skate-team-with-a-royal-mens-duo-0216/).

**What Barp Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- Top-10 World Cup Overall in 2025-26; 3 World Cup podiums (all 2nds)
- [Team sprint free 2nd at Davos (December 2024) with Pellegrino](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-italy-unveils-its-sprint-skate-team-with-a-royal-mens-duo-0216/) — lost to Norway by just +2.04 seconds
- [Olympic relay bronze at this venue](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/22212) — Italy's first men's relay podium since Turin 2006
- Role: Explosive opening legs. Barp's youth and speed keep Italy in the lead pack through Laps 1-5

**What Pellegrino Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- [Olympic sprint classic bronze at this venue on February 10](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/exclusive-federico-pellegrino-cross-country-ski-mico-2026-ultimate-goal) — already medaled at these Games
- [Sprint free silver at 2022 Beijing Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Pellegrino); [sprint classic silver at 2018 PyeongChang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Pellegrino) — he knows how to race Olympic sprint finals better than almost anyone
- [World Championship sprint free gold at Lahti 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Pellegrino); 62 career World Cup podiums; 15 years at the top
- [This is his final competition](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-federico-pellegrinos-tears-0215/) — tearful post-relay interview confirmed 2026 is the end
- Role: The tactical maestro. Pellegrino's sprint intelligence — reading gaps, choosing when to go, managing corner positioning — is unmatched among active athletes

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
The Davos team sprint (December 2024) is the blueprint: Barp and Pellegrino finished 2nd behind Norway by 2.04 seconds. They have proven team sprint chemistry and role clarity. Racing at home in Tesero, with Pellegrino's farewell hanging over the stadium, Italy will have 15,000 fans providing an emotional tailwind that no other team receives.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Federico Pellegrino has dreamed of this moment for 15 years — an Olympic medal at home in Italy. He already has two bronzes this week. Now, for his final race ever, he pairs with 23-year-old Elia Barp — the young Italian who pushed Norway to within two seconds in the team sprint at Davos. The legend and the heir. The emotion in this stadium will be extraordinary."*

### BIB 02 — USA: Ben Ogden (Red) / Gus Schumacher (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
The strongest American men's team sprint pairing in history. Ogden [won Olympic sprint classic silver on February 10](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/winter-olympics-2026-ben-ogden-cross-country-skiing-sprint-silver-knitting) — the [first American men's XC Olympic medal in 50 years, since Bill Koch's silver at Innsbruck 1976](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/winter-olympics-2026-ben-ogden-silver-cross-country-sprint/). Schumacher is the [youngest U.S. athlete ever to win a World Cup and first American man in 43 years to do so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Schumacher_(skier)) (Minneapolis 10km skate, 2024), with [back-to-back sprint podiums at Goms in January 2026](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/us-cross-country-skier-gus-schumacher-collects-back-back-world-cup-podiums). They shared [Junior Worlds relay gold in 2019 in Lahti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ogden).

**What Ogden Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- [Olympic sprint silver — +0.87 behind Klaebo](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/ben-ogden-ends-united-states-50-year-medal-drought-cross-country-silver-sprint); 3 career World Cup podiums
- 2x NCAA National Champion (University of Vermont); Master's in Mechanical Engineering
- Nicknamed ["The Bengineer"](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2026/2/10/2026-olympics-5-things-to-know-about-former-ncaa-champion-ben-ogden-who-ended-team-usas-50-year-medal-drought.aspx) — knits sweaters between races as a mindfulness tool
- Role: Ogden brings the momentum and confidence of an athlete who just medaled at the Olympics. His opening laps set the tone for America's medal chase

**What Schumacher Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- 5 World Cup podiums including [2 wins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Schumacher_(skier)); [back-to-back Goms sprint freestyle podiums in January 2026](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/us-cross-country-skier-gus-schumacher-collects-back-back-world-cup-podiums) — peaked at exactly the right time
- Olympic skiathlon crash setback (finished 24th) but used relay (6th) to rebuild confidence
- Trains at [APU's Eagle Glacier training center in Alaska (~5,700 ft)](https://www.adn.com/sports/skiing/2025/09/05/apus-rebuilt-glacier-training-center-is-again-propelling-cross-country-skiers-toward-an-olympic-season/) — altitude advantage
- Role: Schumacher's powerful freestyle skating is his primary weapon. The team sprint free technique suits him better than classic

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
These two have known each other since juniors — they [won Junior Worlds relay gold together in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ogden). Their chemistry is deep. Ogden's sprint-final experience (he literally just stood on an Olympic sprint podium) provides composure in the chaotic mass start. Schumacher's freestyle sprint power — peaking right now based on Goms — provides the closing weapon. The concern: neither has major championship team sprint medal experience in the senior field, and Schumacher's Games have been [emotionally taxing](https://www.adn.com/sports/skiing/2026/02/14/hard-things-are-whats-cool-about-sport-anchorages-gus-schumacher-on-a-tough-olympics-start/).

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Eight days ago, Ben Ogden ended a 50-year American medal drought in men's cross-country skiing. Today he pairs with Gus Schumacher — the man who ended a 43-year drought in World Cup wins. They won a Junior Worlds relay gold together in 2019. Two record-breakers from different corners of America — Vermont and Alaska — chasing another historic medal."*

### BIB 04 — FRANCE: Mathis Desloges (Red) / Jules Chappaz (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
France pairs its distance phenomenon with its sprint specialist. Desloges is the [story of the Games for French skiing: three Olympic silver medals (skiathlon, 10km free, relay)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-mathis-desloges-becomes-frances-first-double-individual-olympic-medallist-0213/) — the [first French man to win multiple individual Olympic XC medals](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/olympic-games-2026-mathis-desloges-and-les-bleus-set-new-records-for-french-cross-country-skiing-at-the-olympic-games-0215/). Chappaz has a [2023 World Championship sprint classic bronze](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-mathis-desloges-and-jules-chappaz-in-the-sprint-skate-team-leonie-perry-and-melissa-gal-in-the-womens-team-0217/) and was [4th at the 2025 Worlds sprint free](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-trondheim-jules-chappaz-within-a-whisker-of-bronze-in-the-sprint-skate-at-the-worlds-johannes-hoesflot-klaebos-tenth-world-title-0227/) — 0.3 seconds from another medal.

**What Desloges Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- 3 Olympic silvers at this venue — the most medaled distance skier in this team sprint field behind Klaebo
- [Second behind Klaebo in every event he entered](https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/frances-desloges-embraces-role-second-153350015.html) — "I accept being second fiddle to Klaebo"
- Outstanding freestyle strength across 10km and skiathlon distance
- Role: Enormous aerobic engine for Laps 1, 3, 5. The concern: the team sprint (1.6km repeated sprints) is fundamentally different from his strongest events (10km+ sustained efforts)

**What Chappaz Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- 6 World Cup sprint podiums; World Championship sprint bronze (2023) and [missed bronze by 0.3s in 2025](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-trondheim-jules-chappaz-within-a-whisker-of-bronze-in-the-sprint-skate-at-the-worlds-johannes-hoesflot-klaebos-tenth-world-title-0227/)
- CRITICAL CONCERN: [contracted gastroenteritis before the Olympics](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-jules-chappaz-will-not-arrive-in-italy-until-saturday-due-to-illness-0205/), arrived late, was [eliminated in quarterfinals of Olympic sprint](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-four-years-of-work-ruined-by-a-stomach-bug-the-distress-of-jules-chappaz-and-the-french-cross-country-skiers-after-their-failure-in-the-classic-sprint-0210/) (13th) — ["four years of work ruined by a stomach bug"](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-four-years-of-work-ruined-by-a-stomach-bug-the-distress-of-jules-chappaz-and-the-french-cross-country-skiers-after-their-failure-in-the-classic-sprint-0210/)
- Role: Sprint closer — IF recovered from illness. Eight days between the individual sprint (Feb 10) and team sprint (Feb 18) gives recovery time

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
On paper, this is a strong construction: France's best distance skier plus France's best sprinter. The unknown: Desloges has never competed in a team sprint at the World Cup or championship level — this format is new to him. And Chappaz's illness may have cost him critical conditioning. If both are healthy and adapted, France is a genuine medal dark horse. If either factor compromises performance, France slides to 6th-8th.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Mathis Desloges has three silver medals at these Games — all behind Klaebo. He embraced the role: 'I accept being second fiddle.' Today he tries a new dance with sprint specialist Jules Chappaz, who calls the team sprint his 'redemption' after illness ruined his individual event. France's greatest ever Olympic cross-country skier and France's best sprinter. The question: can Desloges handle the 1.6km sprint format?"*

### BIB 07 — FINLAND: Lauri Vuorinen (Red) / Joni Maki (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Finland deploys two proven team sprint medalists. Vuorinen holds [2025 World Championship sprint free bronze (individual)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauri_Vuorinen) and [team sprint classic silver](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-trondheim-after-jasmi-joensuus-illness-ristomatti-hakola-and-lauri-vuorinen-put-the-smile-back-on-finlands-face-at-the-worlds-0305/). Maki holds [2022 Olympic team sprint classic silver (with Iivo Niskanen)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_M%C3%A4ki) and [2021 World Championship team sprint free silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_M%C3%A4ki). Together: 4 major championship team sprint medals between them across both techniques.

**What Vuorinen Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- [4th in Olympic sprint classic final on February 10](https://observatorial.com/news/sports/1621028/olympics-lauri-vuorinen-missed-a-medal-in-the-sprint-final/) — narrowly missed bronze, beaten only by Klaebo, Ogden, and Vike
- Finland [filed a formal protest over waxing procedures](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/themes/themes/sports/28517-finland-files-protest-over-olympic-sprint-waxing-dispute.html) after the sprint — motivation fuel
- [2025 Worlds sprint free bronze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauri_Vuorinen) confirms freestyle sprint ability at the highest level
- Role: Vuorinen sets a championship pace on his opening legs; his 4th-place Olympic sprint demonstrates he can run with the very best

**What Maki Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- [Olympic team sprint classic silver (2022 Beijing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_M%C3%A4ki) — the only athlete in this field with an Olympic team sprint medal (apart from Klaebo)
- [World Championship team sprint free silver (2021 Oberstdorf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_M%C3%A4ki) — proven in the exact discipline of this event
- Won his [first notable career medal at Tesero — Junior Worlds bronze in sprint classic, 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_M%C3%A4ki) — venue connection going back 12 years
- Role: The team sprint specialist. Maki's career has been defined by team-format excellence

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
Finland's combined 4 major championship team sprint medals make Vuorinen/Maki the second-most decorated pairing in this field (behind only Klaebo's individual team sprint record). Their strength is format familiarity: both have experienced the specific pressure of Olympic/Worlds team sprint finals and know how to manage pacing, exchanges, and tactical positioning. The concern: neither has elite-level individual sprint results this season — they are team-format specialists rather than individual sprint podium regulars.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Joni Maki won a Junior Worlds medal at this exact venue in 2014. He won Olympic team sprint silver in 2022. Lauri Vuorinen was three tenths of a second from an Olympic medal eight days ago — and Finland were so angry about it they filed a formal protest. This team has motivation and pedigree. The team sprint is literally their format."*

### BIB 05 — SWEDEN: Johan Haggstrom (Red) / Edvin Anger (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Sweden pairs experience with explosive youth. Haggstrom (33) is a [long-serving relay and team sprint specialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_H%C3%A4ggstr%C3%B6m) with 8 World Cup podiums; Anger (23) was [2nd in the Sprint World Cup Overall in 2024-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvin_Anger) and holds [two 2025 World Championship team sprint/relay bronzes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvin_Anger).

**What Haggstrom Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- 8 World Cup podiums (4 second, 4 third) — never won individually but consistently delivers at the top tier
- Selected as [late addition to Swedish Olympic squad in January 2026](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/complete-swedish-cross-country-skiing-team-confirmed-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/) specifically for team sprint experience
- Role: Steady, experienced Leg 1 athlete who keeps Sweden in the pack without overextending

**What Anger Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- [15 World Cup podiums including 3 wins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvin_Anger); [2025 World Championship team sprint classic bronze with Svensson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvin_Anger)
- CONCERN: [Crashed in Olympic skiathlon (DNF)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-edvin-anger-withdraws-from-the-50-km-event-0216/); [withdrew from 50km event](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-edvin-anger-withdraws-from-the-50-km-event-0216/); described himself as ["too heavy to succeed"](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympic-favorite-opens-up-i-felt-too-heavy-to-succeed/) at these Games
- Role: When confident and fit, Anger's explosive closing speed is among the top 5 in the world

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
On talent alone, Anger is one of the best sprint anchors in the field. The unknown is his mental state after a difficult Games: the skiathlon DNF and 50km withdrawal suggest he may not be at his best. Haggstrom provides the stability Sweden needs if Anger is able to deliver on the anchor. If Anger is mentally and physically recovered from his early-Games setbacks, Sweden is a bronze or silver contender. If not, they could slide outside the medals.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Edvin Anger was supposed to be Sweden's golden boy at these Games. A skiathlon crash and a withdrawal later, he told reporters: 'I felt too heavy to succeed.' The team sprint is his redemption race — the format where he won World Championship bronze just last year. The question isn't talent. The question is whether he's found his confidence again."*

## TIER 3: DARK HORSES / MEDAL OUTSIDERS

### BIB 06 — CZECH REPUBLIC: Jiri Tuz (Red) / Michal Novak (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Tuz is 21 years old and [finished 5th in the Olympic sprint classic final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C5%99%C3%AD_Tu%C5%BE) — an extraordinary result for a first-time Olympian from Czech Republic. Novak is the experienced partner (3-time Olympian) with [1 World Cup podium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michal_Nov%C3%A1k_(cross-country_skier)). Together they [finished 7th at the 2025 World Championships team sprint classic](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/jiri-tuz-a-rising-star-with-ambitious-goals/).

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Jiri Tuz is 21 years old. Three months ago almost nobody outside Czech Republic knew his name. Then he finished 5th in the Olympic sprint final — beaten only by Klaebo, Ogden, Vike, and Vuorinen. Four of the best sprinters on the planet, and a 21-year-old from Liberec nearly beat them all. In a team sprint pack finish, he's dangerous."*

---

### BIB 08 — SWITZERLAND: Janik Riebli (Red) / Valerio Grond (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Grond is Switzerland's most exciting sprint prospect: his [anchor leg at the 2025 World Championships relay delivered Switzerland's first relay medal since 1972](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-trondheim-a-historic-second-place-for-switzerland-in-the-mens-relay-at-the-worlds-0306/) — a silver, outsprinting Anger. Swiss coaches say ["they haven't realized how fast he is"](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/swiss-team-they-havent-realized-how-fast-he-is/). Riebli is the team sprint partner (5 World Cup podiums, 8th at 2025 Worlds team sprint classic with Grond).

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"In March 2025, Valerio Grond delivered Switzerland its first relay medal in 53 years. He outsprinted Edvin Anger on the anchor leg. Swiss coaches said it best: 'They haven't realized how fast he is.' Today, teamed with Janik Riebli, Grond gets another chance to prove them right."*

---

### BIB 09 — GREAT BRITAIN: Andrew Musgrave (Red) / James Clugnet (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Musgrave is a 5-time Olympian with a [remarkable 6th in the Olympic 10km free at Tesero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Musgrave). Clugnet [finished 6th at the 2023 World Championship team sprint free in Planica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clugnet). An unconventional distance/sprint pairing from a non-traditional nation.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Andrew Musgrave is a 5-time Olympian competing for Great Britain — not exactly a cross-country powerhouse. But his 6th in the 10km at this venue shows he belongs. James Clugnet finished 6th at the Worlds in this exact event in 2023. Britain won't medal, but they could make the final — and that would be remarkable."*

---

### BIB 10 — CANADA: Antoine Cyr (Red) / Xavier McKeever (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**

## HEAD-TO-HEAD MATCHUP MAP

**The Gold Fight:**
- NOR vs. the field — Norway with Klaebo/Hedegart is the heaviest favorite in any event at these Olympics. The only realistic threat is a fall, tag zone error, or wax failure. Klaebo has lost exactly once in six major championship team sprints (2022 Beijing silver).

**The Silver Fight:**
- ITA vs. USA vs. FIN — Three teams with legitimate medal credentials. Italy has the home crowd and the Davos result (+2.04 behind NOR). USA has the Olympic sprint silver medalist and Goms sprint podium form. Finland has the most team sprint championship medals (4 combined) outside Norway.
- FRA is the wildcard — if Chappaz is recovered from illness, France has the strongest distance/sprint combination in the field.

**The Bronze Fight:**
- SWE vs. FIN vs. SUI — Sweden's medal chances hinge on Anger's mental recovery. Finland and Switzerland both have legitimate closing speed (Maki, Grond) but lack the raw Leg 1 power of the top teams.
- CZE could slot in if the final develops into a tight pack sprint where Tuz's sprint speed becomes decisive.

**The Semifinal Danger:**
Unlike the women's race (which goes directly to a 15-team final), the men's event runs through semifinals. Any top team could be upset in a semifinal heat if they draw against multiple strong opponents. The "lucky loser" provision (6 fastest non-qualifiers advance) provides a safety net, but semifinal positioning is critical.
