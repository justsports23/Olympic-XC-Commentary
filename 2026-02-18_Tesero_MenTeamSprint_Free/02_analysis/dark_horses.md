# Dark Horses — Men's Team Sprint Free
## Milano Cortina 2026 | Tesero, February 18, 2026

---

## Overview

In a field with one dominant team (Norway) and four closely contested medal contenders (Italy, USA, France, Finland), the "dark horse" designation goes to teams with a credible route to the podium that is not yet reflected in conventional pre-race analysis. Three pairings stand out: the Czech Republic, Sweden, and Switzerland. Each has a specific and identifiable reason why they could surprise on the day.

## 1. Czech Republic — BIB 06 (Jiří Tuž / Michal Novák)

**Dark horse case: Youth + Olympic-final experience = dangerous combination**

### The Evidence

Jiří Tuž, 21, finished 5th in the Olympic Sprint Classic on February 10 — the single best result from any non-Norway/non-Italy/non-USA athlete in an individual sprint event at these Games. He was the youngest athlete to reach an Olympic sprint final at this level, and he did it in classic technique. He nearly won a bronze medal in his first Olympic competition, outperforming athletes with far more World Cup experience. When a skier of that calibre is freed from the pressure of individual competition and given the specific format of the team sprint, the results can be explosive.

Michal Novák, 29, provides the experience: five World Championships, three Olympics, and the Czech Republic's all-time best World Championship sprint result (4th in classic sprint, 2023 Planica). He has been competing at World Cup level since 2016. The 2025 World Championships team sprint (7th with Tuž) gives the pair a shared competitive baseline in the exact format.

The Czech Republic pairing also benefits from technique fit. The freestyle format at Tesero's 1.585km course favours powerful skating, and Tuž's results — while best in classic to date — were achieved through raw athletic ability that translates across techniques. Czech staff selected this pairing specifically for the freestyle team sprint.

### Why They Could Reach the Podium

1. **Tuž's form is the hottest of any non-favourite athlete at these Games.** Olympic 5th at 21 is not luck — it is elite performance.
2. **The team sprint is a different event from the individual sprint.** Tactical racing in a pack, positioning, and tag exchanges reduce the pure-speed advantage of more individually accomplished athletes. A tactically smart pair can outsmart faster individual athletes.
3. **The qualifying round seeds the top-performing pairs favourably.** If CZE qualifies strongly, they could avoid Norway in the semifinal — and a top-2 semifinal finish from one heat sends them directly to the final.
4. **Tuž's 2019 birth year means he has essentially no Olympic fear ceiling.** Athletes who perform well at their first Olympics frequently exceed expectations in subsequent events at the same Games.

**Realistic ceiling:** A final berth and top-5 result. A bronze medal requires the medal contenders to underperform or make errors. But Tuž's individual form makes this plausible.

## 2. Sweden — BIB 05 (Johan Häggström / Edvin Anger)

**Dark horse case: 15 World Cup podiums of firepower in Anger; tactical experience in Häggström**

### The Evidence

Edvin Anger, 23, ended the 2024-25 season 2nd in the Sprint World Cup Overall standings — second in the entire world — and won his first individual World Cup victory (Sprint Classic, Les Rousses, January 2025). He also won the World Championship team sprint bronze with Oskar Svensson in Trondheim 2025 (classic format). With 15 World Cup podiums at 23, he is objectively one of the three or four best sprint skiers in the world when he is performing.

The complication is that the 2026 Olympics have not gone well for him individually. He crashed in the skiathlon, subsequently withdrew from the 50km event, and described himself as feeling "too heavy to succeed." His relay result was 10th. However, the team sprint is the event where he won his World Championship medal, and it is the format most suited to his strengths: explosive laps, tactical pack racing, and a sprint-specific finishing kick.

Johan Häggström, 33, was specifically selected by the Swedish federation for the team sprint because of his experience in this format. His 8 World Cup podiums (including team sprint and relay legs) across a long career give Sweden a steady hand in the lead leg. Häggström also shared in the Women's team sprint gold in the sprint classic (he and Linn Svahn won Sweden's sprint classic gold earlier in these Games) — that experience at this exact venue may count for something.

### Why They Could Reach the Podium

1. **Anger at his best is a top-three skier in the world in sprint freestyle.** His 2nd-place World Cup Overall in 2024-25 was earned in the same format as this event.
2. **The team sprint is explicitly his best format** — the Trondheim World Championship bronze is direct evidence.
3. **Sweden's seeding (BIB 05) reflects real ability**, giving them a reasonable starting position in the qualifier.
4. **Häggström's composure** in team racing means Anger's role can be the finisher, which maximises his strengths.

**Caveat:** Anger's psychological state after the Olympic setbacks is the key unknown. Athletes who describe feeling "too heavy to succeed" early in a Games can reset — or they can carry that weight forward. The team sprint is his reset opportunity.

## 3. Switzerland — BIB 08 (Janik Riebli / Valerio Grond)

**Dark horse case: Grond is the most composed relay anchor in the field; relay silver in 2025 is the benchmark**

### The Evidence

Valerio Grond, 25, is Switzerland's most exciting sprint talent in a generation, and his anchor leg at the 2025 World Championships relay in Trondheim is already part of Swiss Nordic history. He took the lead, held off Edvin Anger's charge on a notoriously demanding course, and delivered Switzerland's first relay medal at a World Championship or Olympic Games since 1972. Swiss coaches reacted with disbelief: "They haven't realized how fast he is." Grond ran that anchor leg in Trondheim with the composure of an athlete who does not feel pressure in the traditional way — an unusual quality that is enormously valuable in a team sprint final.

His 4 World Cup podiums in sprint-format events (2 × 2nd, 2 × 3rd) confirm his World Cup competitiveness. Swiss team management specifically cited his "top results in free technique" in 2025-26 as their reason for selecting him for the freestyle team sprint.

Janik Riebli, 27, is Grond's established partner — 5 World Cup podiums of his own, and their 8th-place finish together at the 2025 World Championships team sprint classic gives the pair a known competitive baseline. The caveat for Riebli is his illness earlier in these Games (he was withdrawn from the relay and replaced by Noé Naeff); his health going into the team sprint requires a positive update from the Swiss team.

### Why They Could Reach the Podium

1. **Grond's Trondheim relay anchor is the best evidence available of his ability under maximum pressure.** Holding off Edvin Anger (2nd in World Cup Sprint Overall) in a direct fight is elite-level performance.
2. **Switzerland's team sprint has been underrated** — the combination of Grond's raw speed and Riebli's consistency has produced World Cup podiums and a World Championships top-10.
3. **If Riebli is healthy**, Switzerland has a complete package: two athletes with World Cup podium experience in sprint formats.
4. **The freestyle technique is Grond's stronger suit**, maximising his value in this specific event.

**Caveat:** Riebli's illness is a genuine question mark. If he is not at full fitness, Switzerland's ceiling drops significantly.

## Summary

| Team | Dark Horse Case | Likelihood of Podium |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| CZE (Tuž/Novák) | Tuž's Olympic sprint 5th — best non-favourite individual form at these Games | Moderate — needs semifinals execution |
| SWE (Häggström/Anger) | Anger's World Cup sprint credentials; World Championship team sprint bronze | Moderate — depends on Anger's mental reset |
| SUI (Riebli/Grond) | Grond's Trondheim relay anchor; Swiss free technique strength | Lower — Riebli's health is the wildcard |

> None of these teams will beat Norway for gold. But any of them could finish 2nd or 3rd if the four primary silver/bronze contenders (ITA, USA, FRA, FIN) fail to execute in the qualifying rounds or the final.
