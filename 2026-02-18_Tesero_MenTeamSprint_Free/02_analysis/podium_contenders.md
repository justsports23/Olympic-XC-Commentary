# Podium Contenders — Men's Team Sprint Free
## Milano Cortina 2026 | Tesero, February 18, 2026

---

## Overview

The Men's Team Sprint Freestyle at the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics is a race dominated by a single overwhelming favourite, with a genuinely open contest for the remaining two podium places. Norway's Hedegart/Klæbo pairing is so dominant that most pre-race analysis concerns itself not with who wins, but with which two of four closely matched teams — USA, Italy, France, and Finland — join them on the podium.

## 1. Norway — BIB 01 (Einar Hedegart / Johannes Høsflot Klæbo)

**Medal prediction: Gold (overwhelming favourite)**

### Why They Win

Johannes Høsflot Klæbo is the greatest cross-country skier in history by every objective measure. Entering the Men's Team Sprint Freestyle with 4 gold medals already from these Games (skiathlon, sprint, 10km free, 4x7.5km relay), he stands at 9 Olympic golds — the all-time Winter Olympics record, already his. A gold in the team sprint would be his 10th Olympic gold and 5th of this Games alone. He has won every Olympic team sprint final he has entered (2018 PyeongChang, and now seeking 2026) and holds four World Championship team sprint golds.

Klæbo's partner, Einar Hedegart, is arguably the most extraordinary story of the 2026 Games. A biathlete-turned-cross-country-skier who switched disciplines in November 2025, Hedegart went straight from shooting range to Olympic podium, winning three pre-Olympic World Cup races (Beitostølen, Davos, Trondheim), a bronze in the Olympic 10km free, and a gold in the relay. He had never lost to Klæbo in freestyle skiing until the Olympic 10km. His climbing ability (outstanding), V2 efficiency, and aerobic engine are at the elite tier.

This pairing combines the world's greatest sprint tactician (Klæbo) with one of the strongest pure skiers at these Games (Hedegart). Their margin of superiority in qualifying should give them the most favourable starting position for the final, and Klæbo's ability to manage pack dynamics in a mass-start final is unmatched.

**Key strengths:**
- Klæbo's tactical awareness and finish-line speed in mass-start finals are unparalleled
- Hedegart's raw horsepower up the decisive climb will ensure Norway is never out of position
- The pairing has relay chemistry from the relay gold earlier in these Games
- Norway can qualify first and dictate pace in the final

**Risk factors:**
- None realistic at competitive level; injury is the only scenario that changes this calculus
- A crash or equipment failure is the only plausible route to Norway missing a medal

**Venue history:** Klæbo has won four events at this exact course during these Games. This is his backyard.

## 2. Italy — BIB 03 (Elia Barp / Federico Pellegrino)

**Medal prediction: Silver (co-favourite for 2nd place)**

### Why They Contend

Italy holds three powerful advantages: home crowd, the world's most experienced sprint tactician, and a defining preview result.

In December 2024 at Davos, Barp and Pellegrino finished 2nd in the World Cup team sprint freestyle — just 2.04 seconds behind Klæbo and Valnes. That result is the most direct pre-race data point for this exact competition format and technique, and it places Italy firmly in the silver medal conversation.

Federico Pellegrino, 35, is competing in his final season. He has four Olympic medals (2018 sprint silver, 2022 sprint silver, 2026 sprint classic bronze, 2026 relay bronze) and 62 World Cup podiums. His tactical mastery in sprint-format mass starts is second only to Klæbo: he knows when to surge, when to sit, how to manage the tag exchange, and how to navigate pack dynamics without burning unnecessary energy. The home crowd at Tesero — Italy's most beloved cross-country venue — provides an emotional lift that experienced athletes channel into controlled aggression.

Elia Barp, 23, is Italy's future: top-10 in the World Cup overall, relay bronze at these Games, and a natural skating technique that produces the explosive V2 power this course demands. He is not carrying the emotional weight of a farewell tour — he can ski freely.

The Italian national team identified this pairing as their "royal men's duo" specifically for the Olympic team sprint skate, and the infrastructure of preparation reflects that designation.

**Key strengths:**
- Davos December 2024 team sprint 2nd place — direct comparable result
- Pellegrino's tactical intelligence in lap-by-lap mass start management
- Home crowd and venue familiarity across Pellegrino's 15-year career
- Barp's raw freestyle power and relay gold experience

**Risk factors:**
- Pellegrino is 35 and in a farewell season; accumulated fatigue from sprint classic and relay events may have reduced his explosive capacity
- The field for silver is genuinely crowded — USA, France, and Finland all have comparable credentials

**Venue history:** Pellegrino has competed at Tesero for over a decade; Barp just won Olympic relay bronze here.

## 3. USA — BIB 02 (Ben Ogden / Gus Schumacher)

**Medal prediction: Silver/Bronze (co-favourite for 2nd–3rd place)**

### Why They Contend

Ben Ogden already has the most important moment in US men's XC history behind him: his Olympic Sprint Classic silver, the first American men's cross-country medal in 50 years. That performance — losing to Klæbo by 0.87 seconds after six laps on this exact 1.585km course — confirmed he can sustain elite sprint velocity for the entirety of this event's demands. His confidence will be at a career high entering the team sprint.

Gus Schumacher brings back-to-back World Cup sprint podiums from Goms (Switzerland) in January 2026, both in freestyle technique. That is the most directly relevant pre-Olympic sprint free form data available, and it places Schumacher among the top five skiers in the world in freestyle sprint immediately before these Games. He had a difficult start to the Olympics (crash in skiathlon, 6th in relay), but the team sprint is his best format.

The USA is seeded 2nd (BIB 02), meaning they have had the second-best combined qualifying seed. That seeding reflects real ability. The chemistry of this pairing — both from roughly the same generation, both with Junior Worlds relay gold together (2019 Lahti) — is genuine rather than assembled.

**Key strengths:**
- Ogden's sprint classic silver directly on this course validates his ability over this distance and format
- Schumacher's back-to-back Goms free sprint podiums are the strongest pre-Olympic freestyle sprint form in the field outside Norway
- BIB 02 seeding gives them strategic positioning in the qualifying round
- Shared Junior Worlds history provides team cohesion

**Risk factors:**
- Schumacher's difficult individual Olympic campaign (crash, 6th relay) carries psychological weight; how he manages that before the team sprint is crucial
- Neither has ever won a World Cup individually in sprint format — their team sprint best is limited to this Olympic appearance as their first time in this combination at this level
- France and Finland have arguably stronger team sprint pedigrees

## 4. France — BIB 04 (Mathis Desloges / Jules Chappaz)

**Medal prediction: Silver/Bronze (dark horse for podium)**

### Why They Contend

France has already delivered the greatest cross-country skiing performance in its Olympic history at these Games: Mathis Desloges's three silver medals (skiathlon, 10km free, relay) are an unprecedented individual achievement for French men's XC at any Olympics. His route to all three was the same: finish second to Klæbo. The question for the team sprint is whether France, in a format where Klæbo operates at the head of a pack rather than in a solo break, can produce a similar level against the full field.

Jules Chappaz is France's sprint specialist — a World Championships bronze medallist (2023 Planica, sprint classic) and the 2025 World Championships 4th-place finisher in sprint free (three tenths from bronze). When healthy, he is one of the best sprint skiers in Europe. The caveat is significant: he was ill at the Olympic sprint classic and finished 13th. He has had 8 days to recover before the team sprint.

The combination is complementary: Desloges provides distance-power endurance across the lap format, while Chappaz provides the specific sprint technique and lap-speed that team sprint freestyle requires.

**Key strengths:**
- Desloges is in the form of his life — confidence from three silver medals is transformative
- Chappaz (when healthy) is arguably the best pure sprint technician in the field after Klæbo
- France's relay silver and Desloges's form prove they can sustain efforts through a full team event
- The format suits Desloges better than individual sprint — multiple laps favour his endurance base

**Risk factors:**
- Chappaz's illness status is unknown; he described the sprint classic result as "four years ruined by a stomach bug" — the psychological impact requires management
- Desloges's best events are all distance-format (10km+), not lap-by-lap sprint racing; this is a genuinely new format for him
- Chappaz/Desloges have less team sprint pedigree than ITA or FIN pairings

## 5. Finland — BIB 07 (Lauri Vuorinen / Joni Mäki)

**Medal prediction: Bronze (most experienced team sprint pairing in the field)**

### Why They Contend

The Vuorinen/Mäki pairing represents the deepest team sprint pedigree of any non-Norwegian team in this field. Joni Mäki has two major team sprint medals: a World Championship silver in team sprint free (2021 Oberstdorf) and an Olympic silver in team sprint classic (2022 Beijing). No other non-Norwegian athlete in the field has two team sprint major medals. He won his first career major medal at Tesero in 2014 (Junior Worlds bronze in sprint classic) — this exact venue.

Lauri Vuorinen is the best active sprint skier Finland has produced in a generation. His 2025 World Championships double — silver in team sprint classic (with Ristomatti Hakola) and bronze in individual sprint free — are the most directly relevant pre-Olympic results in this format and technique for any non-Norwegian athlete. He came within a narrow margin of the Olympic sprint classic podium on February 10, finishing 4th in the final. The emotion of that near-miss — and Finland's formal protest over waxing procedures — will provide additional competitive edge in the team sprint.

**Key strengths:**
- Most team sprint medals of any non-Norwegian pairing (Mäki: 1 WC silver + 1 Oly silver)
- Vuorinen's 2025 Worlds sprint free bronze is directly relevant technique evidence
- Mäki's Tesero venue familiarity (2014 Junior Worlds bronze on this exact course)
- Motivation from near-miss at Olympic sprint classic and the Finnish federation's protest

**Risk factors:**
- Neither Vuorinen nor Mäki had standout individual form at the 2026 Olympic sprint (Vuorinen 4th, Mäki's result [DATA NOT FOUND])
- Finland's team sprint freestyle is strong but may sit one tier below ITA and USA in raw speed
- The format switches to freestyle, where Vuorinen has stronger credentials than Mäki
