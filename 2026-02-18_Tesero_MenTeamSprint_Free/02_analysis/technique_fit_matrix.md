# Technique Fit Matrix — Men's Team Sprint Free
## Milano Cortina 2026 | Tesero, February 18, 2026

---

## Race Demands Profile

The 1.585km Olympic sprint course at Tesero makes the following demands on athletes ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/01/a-sprint-built-for-february-raced-in-january-with-tour-fatigue/); [NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-2026-winter-olympics)):

| Demand | Importance | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Critical | Freestyle technique only; efficient V2/V2-alt is non-negotiable |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Critical | 6 laps in the final; each lap ~3:30–4:00; total effort ~21–24 min |
| Climbing ability | High | Long sustained climb per lap is the course's selective element |
| Recovery speed | High | ~3–5 min recovery between own laps; insufficient recovery tanks the anchor athlete |
| Team synchronization | Moderate | Tag exchange quality; pace communication; shared race strategy |
| Venue familiarity | Moderate | Experience on specific course climbs and turns reduces energy waste |

## Matrix — Top 12 Teams

### 1. Norway — BIB 01 (Hedegart/Klæbo)

| Attribute | Hedegart | Klæbo | Team Rating |
|-----------|---------|-------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Elite | Elite | **Elite** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Elite | Elite | **Elite** |
| Climbing ability | Elite | Elite | **Elite** |
| Recovery speed | Strong | Elite | **Elite** |
| Team synchronization | Strong | Elite (relay gold) | **Strong–Elite** |
| Venue familiarity | Strong (3 events at Tesero) | Elite (4 golds here) | **Elite** |

**Summary:** The only all-Elite team in the field. No meaningful weakness. This pairing was built for this exact event on this exact course.

---

### 2. USA — BIB 02 (Ogden/Schumacher)

| Attribute | Ogden | Schumacher | Team Rating |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Strong | Elite (Goms double podium) | **Strong–Elite** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Elite (sprint silver over 6 laps on this course) | Strong | **Strong–Elite** |
| Climbing ability | Average–Strong | Average–Strong | **Average–Strong** |
| Recovery speed | Strong | Average | **Average–Strong** |
| Team synchronization | Strong (Junior Worlds relay 2019) | Strong | **Strong** |
| Venue familiarity | Strong (sprint silver here Feb 10) | Average (6th relay, 24th skiathlon) | **Average–Strong** |

**Summary:** Strong across all metrics. No Elite-level weakness. Schumacher's freestyle speed is a genuine elite-tier asset. The slight concern is climbing ability and recovery between laps compared to Norway and Italy.

---

### 3. Italy — BIB 03 (Barp/Pellegrino)

| Attribute | Barp | Pellegrino | Team Rating |
|-----------|------|-----------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Strong–Elite | Elite (2022 sprint free silver) | **Elite** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Strong | Strong (fatigue risk at 35) | **Strong** |
| Climbing ability | Strong | Strong (Tesero specialist) | **Strong** |
| Recovery speed | Strong | Average (35 years, multi-event fatigue) | **Average–Strong** |
| Team synchronization | Strong (Davos 2nd Dec 2024) | Elite (15 years team sprint) | **Strong–Elite** |
| Venue familiarity | Strong (relay bronze here) | Elite (15-year career at Tesero) | **Elite** |

**Summary:** Technique fit is very strong. The one concern is Pellegrino's physical recovery capacity at 35 after multiple Olympic events. His tactical intelligence compensates. Venue familiarity is Elite for Pellegrino — the best in the field aside from Klæbo.

### 4. France — BIB 04 (Desloges/Chappaz)

| Attribute | Desloges | Chappaz | Team Rating |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Elite (10km free silver, relay silver) | Strong (2025 Worlds sprint free 4th) | **Strong–Elite** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Strong | Strong (when healthy) | **Average–Strong** |
| Climbing ability | Strong (three podiums on this course) | Average | **Average–Strong** |
| Recovery speed | Strong | Unknown (illness impact) | **Average** |
| Team synchronization | Average (new team sprint pairing) | Average | **Average** |
| Venue familiarity | Strong (three silver medals here) | Average (13th sprint classic here) | **Average–Strong** |

**Summary:** Individual freestyle quality is excellent (Desloges is an Elite skater). The weakness is team synchronization — Desloges/Chappaz is a relatively new team sprint pairing, and Chappaz's illness creates a recovery speed unknown. If Chappaz is healthy, France's ceiling rises significantly.

### 5. Sweden — BIB 05 (Häggström/Anger)

| Attribute | Häggström | Anger | Team Rating |
|-----------|----------|-------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Strong | Elite (2nd World Cup Sprint Overall 2024-25) | **Strong–Elite** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Strong | Strong | **Strong** |
| Climbing ability | Average | Strong (Goms classic sprint podium) | **Average–Strong** |
| Recovery speed | Strong | Average (early-Games fatigue?) | **Average–Strong** |
| Team synchronization | Strong (established team sprint pairing) | Strong (World Championship team sprint bronze) | **Strong** |
| Venue familiarity | Average (30th sprint classic here) | Average (DNF skiathlon, 10th relay) | **Average** |

**Summary:** Anger's freestyle quality is the team's key asset. The concern is psychological state after his difficult individual Games. Venue familiarity is the weakest attribute — neither has performed well individually at Tesero in these Games.

---

### 6. Czech Republic — BIB 06 (Tuž/Novák)

| Attribute | Tuž | Novák | Team Rating |
|-----------|-----|-------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Strong (selected for free team sprint) | Average–Strong | **Average–Strong** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Elite (Olympic sprint 5th) | Strong | **Strong–Elite** |
| Climbing ability | [DATA NOT FOUND] | [DATA NOT FOUND] | **Average [estimated]** |
| Recovery speed | Strong (young athlete, high resilience) | Strong | **Strong** |
| Team synchronization | Strong (2025 Worlds team sprint 7th together) | Strong | **Strong** |
| Venue familiarity | Strong (5th sprint classic here Feb 10) | Average (7th relay here) | **Average–Strong** |

**Summary:** Tuž's Olympic sprint performance is the team's standout credential. Freestyle quality is the uncertainty — Tuž's best results have been in classic. Recovery speed and team synchronization are genuine strengths.

---

### 7. Finland — BIB 07 (Vuorinen/Mäki)

| Attribute | Vuorinen | Mäki | Team Rating |
|-----------|---------|------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Elite (2025 Worlds sprint free bronze) | Strong | **Strong–Elite** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Strong (4th Olympic sprint final) | Strong | **Strong** |
| Climbing ability | [DATA NOT FOUND] | [DATA NOT FOUND] | **Average [estimated]** |
| Recovery speed | Strong | Strong | **Strong** |
| Team synchronization | Elite (two major team sprint medals) | Elite (best team sprint record outside NOR) | **Elite** |
| Venue familiarity | Average (4th sprint classic here, multiple prior WC visits) | Strong (2014 Junior Worlds bronze at Tesero) | **Average–Strong** |

**Summary:** The most experienced team sprint pairing in the field outside Norway. Team synchronization is Elite — no other team has comparable team sprint medal pedigree. Freestyle quality (Vuorinen Worlds sprint free bronze) is proven. The slight gap to Italy and USA is in raw individual speed.

---

### 8. Switzerland — BIB 08 (Riebli/Grond)

| Attribute | Riebli | Grond | Team Rating |
|-----------|--------|-------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Strong | Elite (relay anchor, Swiss "top results in free technique") | **Strong–Elite** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Average–Strong | Strong | **Average–Strong** |
| Climbing ability | Average | Strong (held off Anger in Trondheim relay) | **Average–Strong** |
| Recovery speed | Unknown (illness concern) | Strong | **Average [illness wildcard]** |
| Team synchronization | Average (2025 Worlds 8th together) | Average | **Average** |
| Venue familiarity | Average (23rd sprint classic here) | Average (9th relay here) | **Average** |

**Summary:** Grond's Trondheim relay anchor performance elevates Switzerland's ceiling. Riebli's illness is the key unknown. If healthy, Switzerland is a legitimate semi-finalist. Team synchronization and venue familiarity are the lowest-ranked attributes.

---

### 9. Great Britain — BIB 09 (Musgrave/Clugnet)

| Attribute | Musgrave | Clugnet | Team Rating |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Strong–Elite (10km free 6th here) | Strong | **Strong** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Strong (distance strength applied to sprint laps) | Average | **Average–Strong** |
| Climbing ability | Strong | Average | **Average–Strong** |
| Recovery speed | Strong | Average | **Average–Strong** |
| Team synchronization | Average (new pairing) | Average | **Average** |
| Venue familiarity | Strong (16th sprint here TdS; 6th 10km here) | Average (45th sprint qualifier) | **Average–Strong** |

**Summary:** Musgrave's distance base provides sustainable repeated sprint capacity that is underestimated. Clugnet's sprint specialisation is the team's specific speed asset. Team synchronization is the main limitation of this newer pairing.

---

### 10. Canada — BIB 10 (Cyr/McKeever)

| Attribute | Cyr | McKeever | Team Rating |
|-----------|-----|---------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Strong | Strong (sprint free Olympic Trials winner) | **Strong** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Strong | Average–Strong (developing) | **Average–Strong** |
| Climbing ability | Strong (4th TdS mass start at this venue) | Average | **Average–Strong** |
| Recovery speed | Strong | Strong (13th skiathlon shows aerobic base) | **Strong** |
| Team synchronization | Strong (Canada's best team format record) | Average | **Average–Strong** |
| Venue familiarity | Strong (4th mass start at Tesero 2023, 5th relay 2026) | Average (13th skiathlon, 5th relay) | **Average–Strong** |

**Summary:** Canada is a dangerous semifinalist. Cyr's team format record (5th 2022 Olympics, 4th 2023 Worlds freestyle) is directly relevant. McKeever is the youngest member of this pair but showed unexpected Olympic capability. Venue familiarity is better than expected.

### 11. Austria — BIB 11 (Föttinger/Moser)

| Attribute | Föttinger | Moser | Team Rating |
|-----------|----------|-------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Strong | Strong (Toblach mass start 2nd) | **Strong** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Average | Average–Strong | **Average** |
| Climbing ability | Average | Average | **Average** |
| Recovery speed | Average | Average | **Average** |
| Team synchronization | Strong (long-term established pair) | Strong | **Strong** |
| Venue familiarity | Average (38th TdS sprint, 46th sprint classic here) | Average (43rd sprint classic here) | **Average** |

**Summary:** Austria's team synchronization is their strongest attribute — Föttinger and Moser have competed together for years, providing tactical cohesion. Individual speed and climbing ability are below the medal contenders. Their 6th at Davos World Cup team sprint free is their best comparable result.

---

### 12. Poland — BIB 13 (Staręga/Bury)

| Attribute | Staręga | Bury | Team Rating |
|-----------|---------|------|------------|
| Freestyle skating quality | Average | [DATA NOT FOUND] | **Average** |
| Repeated sprint capacity | Average | [DATA NOT FOUND] | **Average** |
| Climbing ability | Average | [DATA NOT FOUND] | **Average** |
| Recovery speed | Average | [DATA NOT FOUND] | **Average** |
| Team synchronization | Strong (four Olympics together) | Strong | **Strong** |
| Venue familiarity | Average (68th TdS overall 2025-26) | [DATA NOT FOUND] | **Average** |

**Summary:** Poland's strength is their long partnership (Staręga/Bury have raced together for many years, including 13th at 2018 PyeongChang in this same event). Individual speed metrics place them below the medal conversation. A final appearance would be an excellent result.
