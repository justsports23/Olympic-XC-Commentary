## FIS Nordic World Ski Championships

### 1991 — Val di Fiemme's First World Championships

Val di Fiemme hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships for the first time in 1991. The event predated the introduction of the individual sprint discipline (sprint was added to the World Championships programme in 2001 in Lahti). No sprint or team sprint events were contested.

Key events held at Tesero in 1991 included men's and women's cross-country races at standard distances (30km, 50km, 4×10km relay, etc.).

## Tour de Ski at Val di Fiemme

The Tour de Ski has included Val di Fiemme stages since its inaugural edition in 2006-07. The venue is typically the penultimate or final stage of the Tour, and the legendary Alpe Cermis final climb (mass start final leg from Tesero to the summit of Alpe Cermis) is the Tour's defining moment.
