## Notes on Course Equivalence

The 1.585km Olympic sprint course used in 2026 is a purpose-built sub-circuit within the Tesero venue network. It was designed specifically for the 2026 Games and first raced at the Tour de Ski in January 2026. All previous World Championships and Tour de Ski sprint events at Val di Fiemme used different course configurations with different total climb, elevation differential, and layout. **Direct time comparisons between 2003/2013 World Championships sprint results and 2026 Olympic sprint results are not valid.**
