## Personal Background
Peshkov was born December 23, 2002, in [Sapareva Banya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapareva_Banya) — a small spa town in southwestern Bulgaria at the northern foot of the Rila Mountains, adjacent to one of Bulgaria's primary cross-country training areas. Growing up in the Rila foothills likely gave him early access to consistent snow conditions and mountain training terrain unavailable to most Bulgarian youth athletes. He competes for SK Panichishte 2009, named for the Panichishte area — a nearby ski terrain in the Rila Mountains.

## Training Base
Sapareva Banya / Panichishte area, Rila Mountains, Bulgaria.

## Key Storylines
Peshkov's 23rd-place World Championship team sprint result at Planica 2023 is stronger than his individual rankings suggest, indicating he elevates for team formats. His endurance base — confirmed by a 50km World Championships finish at Trondheim 2025 — provides the physical platform for the six-leg team sprint structure. He and Matikanov have raced as a team sprint pair at World Championships, giving Bulgaria the coordination edge.

**Pairing note:** Peshkov's endurance and Rila Mountains background complement Matikanov's youth and freestyle distance speed. Their established pairing chemistry from Trondheim 2025 (29th together) is a practical asset in the Olympic team sprint's high-stakes leg-transition moments. Peshkov's endurance provides insurance if either athlete faces difficulty mid-race.
