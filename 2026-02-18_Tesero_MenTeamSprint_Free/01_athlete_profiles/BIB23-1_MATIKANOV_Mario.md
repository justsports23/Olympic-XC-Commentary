## Personal Background
Born August 15, 2004, in Bulgaria. Matikanov is a student at the [National Sports Academy](https://bnrnews.bg/en/post/421542/bulgarian-skiers-at-2026-olympics-no-excessive-ambitions-huge-determination) in Sofia — Bulgaria's leading sports university — where he combines elite coaching with academic study. He won his third Bulgarian national championship title in March 2025 in Bansko. His Turin 2025 Universiade bronze medal came at a competition he would have recognised well given the proximity to the Tesero Olympic venue.

## Key Storylines
At 21, Matikanov is already a multiple national champion and Universiade bronze medallist. His development arc — three national titles plus a sub-50 Olympic interval start result — is ahead of schedule for his age. Paired with Daniel Peshkov at Trondheim 2025 (29th team sprint), the Bulgaria duo have championship team sprint experience together.

**Pairing note:** Matikanov and Peshkov have raced as a team before — their 29th at Trondheim 2025 World Championships gives them the crucial advantage of prior pairing experience at championship level. Matikanov provides the freestyle distance strength and youth; Peshkov brings endurance depth and technique versatility. Their coordination is likely better than most debut Olympic team sprint pairings.
