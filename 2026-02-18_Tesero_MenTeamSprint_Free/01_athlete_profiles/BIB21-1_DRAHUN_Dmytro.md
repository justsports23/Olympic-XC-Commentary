## Key Storylines
Drahun's role as a Paralympic guide for Iaroslav Reshetynskyi in para-ski World Cup events is an unusual distinction and speaks to his technical mastery, since guide skiing requires precise synchronisation at race pace [UNVERIFIED]. His Olympic debut at approximately 28 follows years of World Championship relay service for Ukraine ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=213460)).

**Pairing note:** Drahun (experienced, relay-proven) and the younger Lisohor (Junior Worlds 14th twice, rapidly developing) form a Ukraine pairing that balances experience and potential. Both have reached 18th as their World Cup individual best ([FIS Athlete Profile — Drahun](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=213460)), suggesting well-matched raw speeds — an advantage in the alternating-leg team sprint format.
