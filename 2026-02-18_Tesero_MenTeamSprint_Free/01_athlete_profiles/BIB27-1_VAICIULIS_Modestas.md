## Personal Background
Born April 11, 1989, in Lithuania ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modestas_Vai%C4%8Diulis)). Vaičiulis has been the constant figure in Lithuanian men's cross-country skiing for over 15 years. His connection to the Strolia family runs deep in Lithuanian skiing — at Vancouver 2010 he partnered with Mantas Strolia to achieve the 18th-place team sprint result ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modestas_Vai%C4%8Diulis)), and now at Milano Cortina 2026 he partners with Mantas's younger brother Tautvydas. The family skiing lineage of the Strolias — father Vytautas (national biathlon champion) ([LRT](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/2815214/chasing-the-dream-how-vytautas-strolia-found-his-olympic-path-in-biathlon)), sons Mantas (2010, 2018 Olympian) and Tautvydas (2022, 2026 Olympian) ([Wikipedia — Tautvydas Strolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautvydas_Strolia)) — creates an extraordinary multi-generational connection with Vaičiulis's career.

## Training Base

## Key Storylines
Vaičiulis's four-Olympics career arc — from Vancouver 2010 to Milano Cortina 2026 at age 36 — spans 16 years of Lithuanian cross-country skiing ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modestas_Vai%C4%8Diulis)). His Vancouver 2010 team sprint result (18th) with the older Strolia brother ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modestas_Vai%C4%8Diulis)), now replicated with the younger Strolia brother at these Games, is one of the most poignant storylines in the entire team sprint field. He is one of the most experienced athletes in this race on the BIB list.

**Pairing note:** The Vaičiulis-Tautvydas Strolia pairing at these Games echoes the Vaičiulis-Mantas Strolia pairing at Vancouver 2010, which produced Lithuania's best modern Olympic team sprint result ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modestas_Vai%C4%8Diulis)). Vaičiulis brings 16 years of international team sprint experience; Tautvydas brings World Championship relay top-20 consistency ([Wikipedia — Tautvydas Strolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautvydas_Strolia)) and a personal family legacy in the event. Lithuania's team sprint heritage is built on this exact dynamic.
