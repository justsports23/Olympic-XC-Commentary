## Key Storylines
Xavier McKeever is a second-generation Olympian from one of Canada's most celebrated ski families. His mother, Milaine Thériault, competed at Nagano 1998, Salt Lake City 2002, and Turin 2006. His father, Robin McKeever, is an Olympian who became the guide for his brother — Xavier's uncle — Brian McKeever, the most decorated Winter Paralympic athlete in Canadian history (20 medals). Xavier started skiing at age 2 and began competing at 5. He was inspired to commit to cross-country skiing after watching his father and uncle win three gold medals at the Vancouver 2010 Paralympic Games. He secured his Olympic spot by winning the sprint free event at the 2026 Canadian Olympic Trials. Described as "surreal" by McKeever himself, his Olympic debut exceeded expectations with a 13th-place finish in the skiathlon. He is currently studying Bachelor of Aviation Management at Mount Royal University. He is known for building Lego as a pre-race focus and concentration ritual. His partnership with the experienced Antoine Cyr gives Canada a potent combination of youth and experience.

**Pairing note:** McKeever brings the sprint-freestyle power that secured his Olympic selection — his Trials win confirms he belongs at this level. Paired with Cyr's wealth of team-sprint experience, Canada has a duo capable of punching above expectation in qualifying. McKeever's Lego ritual and calm demeanor suggest he handles pressure well.
