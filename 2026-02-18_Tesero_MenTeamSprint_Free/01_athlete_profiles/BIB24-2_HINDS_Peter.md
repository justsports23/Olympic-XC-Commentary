## Personal Background
Peter Hinds grew up in Anchorage, Alaska, attending [Dimond High School](https://alaskasportsreport.com/2026/02/born-and-raised-in-alaska-hinds-is-headed-to-the-olympics-with-slovakia/) — the same school that has produced multiple Alaskan winter sports athletes. He graduated from the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) with a degree in civil engineering. His mother Elena Hinds grew up in Bratislava (then part of the Eastern Bloc) and followed Slovak cross-country skiing; she encouraged Peter to explore whether he could represent Slovakia. He realised in 2024 he was eligible through Slovakian citizenship, switched his FIS registration, and within one year qualified for the Olympics. He is described in Alaskan sports media as one of those kids who "grew up with ski trails and mountains as his playgrounds."

## Training Base
Trained at University of Alaska Anchorage (NCAA); now competing on the European World Cup circuit. Former home training base: Anchorage, Alaska — Kincaid Park and surrounding trail networks.

## Key Storylines
Hinds's story has attracted significant Alaskan and Slovak media attention: an Anchorage-born civil engineering graduate who qualified for the Olympics within a year of switching national federations. His rapid World Cup improvement — six consecutive top-60 results and a 25th at Goms — shows his UAA training was producing results that the US national team system might not have been offering him the same platform for. His welcome by Slovakia's president underlines the significance of his debut for Slovak winter sport.

**Pairing note:** Hinds brings the most recent World Cup competitive results of the Slovakia pairing — his 25th at Goms is the best recent benchmark for this team sprint. Paired with the junior Czech teammate Čeněk, Hinds is the established senior sprinter carrying Slovakia's best chance of heat survival, while Čeněk provides the national skiing culture rooting in Slovakia itself.
