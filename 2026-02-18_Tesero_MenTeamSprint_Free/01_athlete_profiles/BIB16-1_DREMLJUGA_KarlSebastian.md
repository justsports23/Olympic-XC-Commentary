## Key Storylines
Dremljuga represents Estonia's next sprint generation. At just 24, his Olympic debut at these Games — competing in both sprint classic and team sprint — marks a significant step in his development ([Estonia at the 2026 Winter Olympics — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics)). His World Cup career best of 18th at Tallinn, a home race on familiar fast ice, signals genuine sprint capacity ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/karl-sebastian-dremljuga-cross-country-skiing-spf575617.html)).

**Pairing note:** Alongside the experienced Martin Himma, Dremljuga brings youth and raw sprint speed to Estonia's team sprint. Himma's Olympic experience and composure anchor the pair while Dremljuga supplies the aggressive leg pace that suits the freestyle format.
