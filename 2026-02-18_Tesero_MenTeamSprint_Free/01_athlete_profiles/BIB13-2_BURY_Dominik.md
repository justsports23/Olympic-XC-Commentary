## Key Storylines
Dominik Bury is the younger generation of the Polish sprint pair alongside Maciej Staręga. Born in Cieszyn, he competes for AZS AWF Katowice and has built an impressive CV over five World Championship appearances. His 8th place at the 2023 World Championships in Planica was Poland's best-ever Team Sprint result at the World level — representing a genuine breakthrough for Polish cross-country skiing. Together with Staręga at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics (13th), they forged Poland's Olympic Team Sprint record. His brother Kamil Bury is also a professional skier, making this a Nordic skiing family. Bury brings the youthful power to complement the veteran Staręga's experience, though at 29 he himself is now an experienced World Cup competitor. The freestyle technique (the format in this Olympic Team Sprint) has historically been their stronger suit, with their best international results coming in skate-dominated events.

**Pairing note:** Bury is Poland's explosive finisher — the last-lap specialist whose best career result (8th, 2023 Worlds team sprint free) came in this exact format. His partnership with Staręga has produced Poland's best results in this event across three Olympic cycles. At 29, Bury is in the prime years for a sprint specialist, and his freeskate ability makes the freestyle format his strongest terrain.
