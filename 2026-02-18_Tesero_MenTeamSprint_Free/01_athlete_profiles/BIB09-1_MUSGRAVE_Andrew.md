## Key Storylines
Five-time Olympian (Vancouver 2010, Sochi 2014, PyeongChang 2018, Beijing 2022, Milano Cortina 2026) ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/andrew-musgrave)), Andrew Musgrave is the elder statesman of British cross-country skiing. Born in Dorset, he grew up partly in Shetland and Alaska before settling in Aberdeenshire ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Musgrave)). For over two decades he has been based in Trondheim, Norway, training full-time and integrating into the Norwegian ski culture while competing for GB ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Musgrave)). His 6th place in the 10 km freestyle at Milano Cortina 2026 set a new British Olympic record, surpassing his own previous best of 7th at PyeongChang 2018 ([Milano Cortina 2026 results](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/39391)). Described by Nordic Mag as enjoying a "hot streak" at these Games after a viral moment running shirtless in the snow prior to competition ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-andrew-musgraves-hot-streak-after-running-shirtless-0213/)). The Team Sprint is a secondary event for Musgrave given his distance pedigree; he brings consistency, experience, and strong technique to the pairing with Clugnet.

**Pairing note:** Musgrave provides the aerobic durability and tactical composure that comes with 5 Olympics; Clugnet brings the sprint-specific speed and best-ever British result in the team sprint format (6th, 2023 Worlds with Young). This is a complementary pairing — Musgrave's distance power in the opening laps; Clugnet's sprint finesse in the critical exchanges.
