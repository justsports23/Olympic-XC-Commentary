## Key Storylines
Li Minglin's Olympic debut places him alongside one of the most accomplished sprint skiers in Chinese history in Wang Qiang. This team sprint pairing gives China its first serious opportunity to combine youth development with proven senior sprint capability at an Olympics. Li's performance in the distance events at these Games (65th in skiathlon) provides baseline senior-level Olympic experience ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=237164)).

**Pairing note:** Li Minglin's role is as support partner to Wang Qiang in this team sprint. Wang carries the sprint-final finishing capacity while Li provides reliable leg-splitting in the early rounds. China's route to advancement depends on Wang's performances; Li's consistent pacing through his legs could keep the pair competitive in the qualification rounds.
