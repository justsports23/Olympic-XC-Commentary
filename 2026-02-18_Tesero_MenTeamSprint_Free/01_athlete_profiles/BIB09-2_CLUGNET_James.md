## Key Storylines
James Clugnet was born and raised in the French Alps near Grenoble — his father is a French ski enthusiast and his mother is English ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clugnet)). He competed on the French junior circuit before joining the British national team at age 16 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clugnet)). He holds a Bachelor's degree in Sport Sciences from Grenoble Alpes University (2019) ([Olympics Biography](https://olympicsbiography.com/james-clugnet/)). His best international result came with Andrew Young in the Team Sprint, where the British pair reached 6th at the 2023 World Championships in Planica — the best-ever British result in that event ([GB Snowsport](https://gbsnowsport.com/seven-athletes-named-in-squad-for-cross-country-world-championships/)). He has now transitioned to pairing with Andrew Musgrave for Milano Cortina 2026, bringing younger sprint energy to the experienced partnership. His individual sprint classic at these Games ended in qualification (45th), setting up the Team Sprint as Britain's main medal hope format.

**Pairing note:** Clugnet is GB's sprint engine — his 6th at Planica 2023 team sprint remains the benchmark for what British men can achieve in this format ([GB Snowsport](https://gbsnowsport.com/seven-athletes-named-in-squad-for-cross-country-world-championships/)). Pairing with Musgrave adds aerobic depth and tactical authority. The team sprint is legitimately Britain's best shot at a top-8 diploma at these Games.
