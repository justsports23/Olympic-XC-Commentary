## Key Storylines
Jaume Pueyo is the leading figure of a historic generation of Catalan cross-country skiers ([Ara.cat](https://en.ara.cat/sports/the-golden-generation-of-catalan-cross-country-skiers-who-want-to-make-history-at-the-games_130_5643215.html)). Born in Badalona and raised in La Seu d'Urgell, he became a Salomon-sponsored athlete at just 17 years old in 2018 ([Salomon](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/athlete/pueyo-jaume)) and has rapidly grown into one of the most significant sprint skiers to ever represent Spain. His 7th place at the World Championships in Oberhof represents the best-ever finish by a Spanish cross-country skier at a World Championship event ([GSG/Giessegi](https://www.giessegi.com/en/jaume-pueyo-rewrites-the-history-of-spanish-cross-country-skiing/)). At 24, he is the most experienced of the three Catalan representatives at Milano Cortina 2026 — joining Marc Colell and Bernat Selles in what is the first time three Catalans have simultaneously qualified for cross-country skiing at the Olympics ([Ara.cat](https://en.ara.cat/sports/the-golden-generation-of-catalan-cross-country-skiers-who-want-to-make-history-at-the-games_130_5643215.html)). He describes his aim at these Games as reaching the sprint final and securing a diploma (top-8 finish) [UNVERIFIED]. His 26th place in the Olympic sprint classic fell short of that goal ([Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/148261)), but the Team Sprint freestyle — his stronger format — gives him a final opportunity. He has publicly noted the Tesero course is more technically demanding than courses he normally trains on [UNVERIFIED].

**Pairing note:** Pueyo acts as mentor to the 20-year-old Colell — the senior figure managing tactics in the exchanges while Colell delivers explosive youth energy. In the Catalan skiing golden generation narrative ([Ara.cat](https://en.ara.cat/sports/the-golden-generation-of-catalan-cross-country-skiers-who-want-to-make-history-at-the-games_130_5643215.html)), this pairing is the centerpiece of Spain's Olympic ambitions. Reaching the semifinal would be a historic Spanish result in the team sprint.
