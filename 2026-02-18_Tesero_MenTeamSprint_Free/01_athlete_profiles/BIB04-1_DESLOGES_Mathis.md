- **Sprint ability:** Developing — World Cup best of 6th suggests top-tier but not proven sprint-specialist level; selected for team sprint suggests staff believes in his sprint-format ability
- **Distance preference:** Middle-to-long distance (10km and skiathlon); excels in longer sustained efforts
- **Best format:** Interval start distance events (10km and up) and relay legs; team sprint represents a newer format for him

## Key Storylines
Mathis Desloges from Villard-de-Lans has produced the greatest individual performance by a French cross-country skier in Olympic history. His three silver medals at the 2026 Games — all behind Johannes Klaebo — shattered French records. He became the first French man to win multiple individual Olympic medals in cross-country skiing and the first French cross-country skier to reach the podium on distance events since 2006. On every occasion he was second, Klaebo was first; the media dubbed him "Klaebo's shadow" and he has embraced the role with equanimity, telling reporters: "I accept being second fiddle to Klaebo."

At just 23 years old in his first Olympic Games, the emotional weight of this performance — combined with France's strong showing in the relay silver — makes Desloges one of the stories of the Games. His father Vincent, interviewed by Nordic Mag after the 10km silver, said the achievement was "unimaginable."

Pairing with sprint specialist Jules Chappaz for the Team Sprint Freestyle, Desloges brings distance power and relay experience. However, the team sprint format (six shorter laps of roughly 1.6km) is different to his strongest events; this will be his biggest test in an unfamiliar format.

Desloges is passionate about training science — he reads sports science literature, exchanges ideas with athletes from other disciplines, and experiments methodically. He trains with 100km sessions and studies the Norwegian method closely. His coach Thibaut Chêne noted in April 2025 that Desloges arrived on the World Cup circuit "with the least certainty" of any French athlete and "really responded."

**Key Quote:** "I've never skied so fast in my life." — Desloges after his 10km skate silver medal, [Nordic Mag, Feb 13 2026](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/olympic-games-2026-cross-country-skiing-ive-never-skied-so-fast-in-my-life-olympic-silver-medallist-in-the-10-km-skate-mathis-desloges-enjoys-another-moment-of-intense-happiness-0213/)

**Pairing note:** Desloges provides the aerobic engine and sustained skating power across his three laps; Chappaz provides sprint-specialist closing speed. France's best shot at a medal rests on Desloges maintaining relay-level performance in shorter lap format, and Chappaz arriving healthy after his illness recovery.
