## Key Storylines
Maciej Starega is the veteran elder statesman of the Polish cross-country skiing team at Milano Cortina 2026. Now 36 years old, he is competing at his fourth Olympic Games having first appeared at Sochi 2014 ([Sochi 2014 profile](http://sochi2014.arch.articul.ru/www.sochi2014.com/en/athlete-maciej-starega.htm)). He grew up in Siedlce and chose cross-country skiing at age 12, inspired by his father's passion for the sport ([Polski Komitet Olimpijski](https://olimpijski.pl/en/olimpijczycy/maciej-starega/)). His eight World Championship appearances and four Olympic Games make him one of the most experienced athletes in the Polish squad ([Olympics Wiki Fandom](https://olympics.fandom.com/wiki/Maciej_Star%C4%99ga)). He is married to biathlete Monika Hojnisz-Starega, with the couple sharing a rare dual-Olympic household ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maciej_Starega)). His 2025-26 season Tour de Ski result (68th overall) and sprint qualification at Trondheim (50th) suggest his form may not be at its peak, but his vast experience in the Team Sprint format — most notably the 13th place alongside Dominik Bury at PyeongChang 2018 ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/maciej-starega)) — makes him a measured and experienced team partner.

**Pairing note:** Starega brings 4 Olympics and 8 World Championships worth of experience — an irreplaceable asset in the multi-heat team sprint format where managing effort is as important as raw speed ([Olympics Wiki Fandom](https://olympics.fandom.com/wiki/Maciej_Star%C4%99ga)). Bury provides the explosive power. Poland's goal is advancing out of qualifying; their freestyle technique team sprint 8th at 2023 Worlds (Bury and Starega) is the benchmark [UNVERIFIED].
