## Key Storylines
Back-to-back 14th-place finishes at the Junior Worlds signal that Lisohor is not a one-year wonder — he has consistent championship-level ability at junior age ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=238457)). His transition to senior World Cup level (18th at Engadin) has already produced results matching his more experienced teammates ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=238457)). At approximately 21, his career ceiling remains undefined.

**Pairing note:** Lisohor's youth and rapidly ascending form make him an ideal complement to the more experienced Drahun. Both having a career World Cup best of 18th at Engadin suggests well-matched legs for the team sprint format ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=238457)). Lisohor's Junior Worlds record shows he performs under pressure, which is critical in the knockout-format team sprint.
