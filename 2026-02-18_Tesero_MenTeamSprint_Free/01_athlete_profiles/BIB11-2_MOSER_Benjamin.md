## Key Storylines
Benjamin Moser claimed his first World Cup podium at Toblach on December 31, 2025, in the 5 km mass start skate heat at the Tour de Ski. His reaction — "It's simply incredible, I'm speechless" — captured the significance of the breakthrough. Moser hails from Maurach in Tirol and has been a consistent presence on the Austrian World Cup team, forming a long-standing partnership with Michael Föttinger in the Team Sprint event. Their 10th place together at the 2022 Beijing Olympics remains their shared benchmark. The four appearances at the World Championships include an 11th place Team Sprint Free at the 2021 edition. The sprint classic win at Olos/Muonio on the OPA circuit also demonstrates his competitive range. With the momentum of his Toblach Tour de Ski podium fresh, Moser enters the Olympic Team Sprint as a motivated athlete in career-best form.
