## Key Storylines
Jan Stölben (also spelled Stoelben) is Germany's most experienced sprint specialist currently on the World Cup circuit, forming a complementary partnership with the prodigious teenager Jakob Moch. His 6th place in the sprint classic at Val di Fiemme during the Tour de Ski 2025-26 demonstrates comfort and performance on this very course. His advancement to the Olympic sprint quarterfinals (finishing 5th in his QF round) and participation in the relay (8th place) show he belongs at the highest level. The 2025 World Championships performance — 10th in Team Sprint Classic with Germany — was the team's benchmark heading into Milano Cortina. At 24, Stölben is approaching his peak and the Team Sprint Free format suits his primary strengths. With Moch adding youthful explosive power, Germany's combination is an intriguing one even if a podium finish would represent a significant surprise.

**Pairing note:** Stölben is the experienced anchor of Germany's youth-meets-experience combination. His 6th at this very course (Tour de Ski sprint) and his German national titles in sprint (2022, 2024) confirm he belongs at this level. Moch provides the star power; Stölben provides the consistency.
