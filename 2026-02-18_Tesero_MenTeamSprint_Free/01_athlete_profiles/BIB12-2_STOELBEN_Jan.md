## Key Storylines
Jan Stolben (also spelled Stoelben) is Germany's most experienced sprint specialist currently on the World Cup circuit, forming a complementary partnership with the prodigious teenager Jakob Moch. His 6th place in the sprint classic at Val di Fiemme during the Tour de Ski 2025-26 demonstrates comfort and performance on this very course ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=216450)). His advancement to the Olympic sprint quarterfinals (finishing 5th in his QF round) and participation in the relay (8th place) show he belongs at the highest level ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=216450)). The 2025 World Championships performance — 10th in Team Sprint Classic with Germany — was the team's benchmark heading into Milano Cortina ([Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/jan-stoelben-of-team-germany-competes-during-the-mens-cross-news-photo/2203428745)). At 24, Stolben is approaching his peak and the Team Sprint Free format suits his primary strengths. With Moch adding youthful explosive power, Germany's combination is an intriguing one even if a podium finish would represent a significant surprise.

**Pairing note:** Stolben is the experienced anchor of Germany's youth-meets-experience combination. His 6th at this very course (Tour de Ski sprint) ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=216450)) and his German national titles in sprint (2022, 2024) [UNVERIFIED] confirm he belongs at this level. Moch provides the star power; Stolben provides the consistency.
