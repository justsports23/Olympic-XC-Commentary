## Key Storylines
A 43rd-place Olympic interval start result at approximately 20 years old suggests Muratbekov is on a rapid development trajectory. Back-to-back Junior Worlds 13th-place finishes confirm this was not a single fortunate performance. At these Games he is competing across the full programme (skiathlon, sprint, team sprint, mass start), which reflects Kazakhstan's confidence in his capacity to handle multiple high-intensity events.

**Pairing note:** Muratbekov's youth and freestyle distance strength balance well with Bashmakov's sprint World Cup experience (9th at Lahti). Kazakhstan's team sprint pairing has a genuine floor — Junior Worlds top-15 and Olympic interval top-50 — and the ceiling remains open for the younger athlete.
