## Key Storylines
Janik Riebli leads a double life: elite sprint skier and dairy farmer. When not on the World Cup circuit, he helps manage his family's farm in Switzerland, home to approximately 30 cows producing milk for a specialty Alpine cheese. NBC Olympics profiled him in a feature about going "from farm life to finish line in Italy" ([NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/swiss-cross-country-skier-goes-farm-life-finish-line-italy)). He was born October 27, 1998 ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=193977)).

His 2026 Olympics began with his 23rd-place finish in the sprint classic — below his World Cup form level, but his first Olympic experience ([Wikipedia — Switzerland at the 2026 Winter Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics)). Earlier in the Games, he had been withdrawn from the relay due to illness (replaced by Noé Naeff) ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-changes-for-the-swiss-relay-team-0215/)), which raises questions about his fitness heading into the Team Sprint Freestyle. The Swiss staff's decision to pair him with Valerio Grond — the strongest Swiss sprint skier of his generation — for the team sprint suggests they believe he has recovered.

At the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim, Riebli and Grond finished 8th together in the men's team sprint classic — modest but giving them shared team-format experience ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-team-sprint/)). Switzerland's recent relay history is historically weaker than the sprint nations, but Grond's emergence as a world-class sprinter elevates the Swiss team's ceiling.

**Pairing note:** Riebli and Grond bring the underdog spirit Switzerland needs. Riebli's fitness question marks (illness earlier in the Games) ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-changes-for-the-swiss-relay-team-0215/)) are the wild card; if healthy, his World Cup podium experience adds genuine quality ([the-sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/janik-riebli-cross-country-skiing-spf527969.html)). Grond's world-class anchor speed is the team's ceiling-raiser. Switzerland making the final would be a significant result.
