## Personal Background
Lars Young Vik grew up with a Norwegian father and an Australian mother, [spending formative years on the trails around Oslo's Holmenkollen](https://www.snow.org.au/news/cross-country-skiing-and-social-economics-with-lars-young-vik) ski area before representing Australia ([Snow Australia interview](https://www.snow.org.au/news/cross-country-skiing-and-social-economics-with-lars-young-vik)). He is named after Bjarte Engen Vik's family surname ([Australian Olympic Committee](https://www.olympics.com.au/olympians/lars-young-vik/)). His extraordinary family connection to Olympic cross-country — an uncle who won four Olympic medals for Norway — gives him an unusual depth of skiing heritage for an Australian competitor ([Australian Olympic Committee](https://www.olympics.com.au/olympians/lars-young-vik/)). He continues to train in Oslo during European winters ([SnowsBest](https://www.snowsbest.com/lars-young-vik/)).

## Training Base

## Key Storylines
Vik's story bridges two skiing cultures. Raised on Scandinavian trails but competing under the Australian flag, he is arguably the most technically Scandinavian-trained athlete on Australia's team. The Snow Australia Male Skier of the Year award in two separate seasons (2023, 2025) confirms his standing as Australia's top men's cross-country performer ([Snow Australia](https://www.snow.org.au/news/australian-202526-cross-country-national-team-confirmed)).

**Pairing note:** Vik and the younger Hugo Hinckfuss form a complementary Australian team sprint duo — Vik with Scandinavian training pedigree and World Championship team sprint experience (18th at Planica 2023) ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=224931)), Hinckfuss with NCAA-level sprint training from the University of Colorado. Together they represent Australia's strongest-ever team sprint combination.
