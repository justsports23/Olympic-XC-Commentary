- **Sprint ability:** World Cup best of 7th (Are) and 9th (Lahti) indicates occasional elite-level sprint performance; not a consistent top-10 force but capable of quality individual laps
- **Distance preference:** Sprint specialist with relay/team sprint as natural habitat
- **Best format:** Team sprint — 2019 Worlds 8th demonstrates team format is where he is most competitive

## Key Storylines
Miha Šimenc is Slovenia's most experienced cross-country skier and the elder statesman of the Slovenian sprint squad. Born in Ljubljana and raised in a skiing environment, he has competed for Slovenia at three Olympic Games (2018, 2022, 2026) and four World Championships — a remarkable record of sustained performance for a nation with limited alpine and Nordic skiing depth.

His greatest career result came at the 2019 World Championships in Seefeld, where Slovenia placed 8th in the men's team sprint classic — the best result the country has ever achieved in that event. It is the type of team format success that defines his career arc, given his individual World Cup results (best 7th in Are) have been more sporadic than consistent.

At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the Slovenian relay team of Šimenc, Vili Črv, Miha Ličef, and Janez Lampič placed 14th in the men's 4x10km relay — again, Slovenia's best-ever result in that format at an Olympic Games.

His 2026 Olympic results (31st sprint, 51st in 10km) suggest he is not in his best individual form at these Games, but the Team Sprint Freestyle is historically where he elevates his performance. Partnering with the younger Nejc Štern, he provides the experience and tactical intelligence for Slovenia's pairing.

At 30, this is likely Šimenc's final Olympic Games as a competitive force, making the Team Sprint Freestyle in Tesero on February 18 a personally significant event. Slovenia has demonstrated they can compete in the team sprint format at elite level — the question is whether they can reach the final in the freestyle technique.
