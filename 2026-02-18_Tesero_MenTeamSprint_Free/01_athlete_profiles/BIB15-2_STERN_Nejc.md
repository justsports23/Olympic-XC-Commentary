## Key Storylines
Nejc Štern is one of the youngest athletes in the Men's Team Sprint Freestyle field at 22 years old. Born November 2, 2003, and competing for ŠD Oktan club, he represents Slovenia's next generation of sprint talent. The Slovenian national team for 2025-26 operates under Norwegian coach Ola Vigen Hattestad — a former sprint World Cup champion himself — whose guidance has been central to Slovenia's sprint development program.

Štern's breakthrough moment came in the 2024-25 World Cup season when he and Miha Šimenc finished 11th together in the World Cup team sprint at Cogne, Italy — a result that confirmed the Slovenian pairing could compete at the top level of the sport. The following season, at the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim, the same pairing (Štern and Šimenc) reached 11th in the men's team sprint classic — consistency across two different formats in two consecutive years is exactly the type of evidence selectors look for.

His Olympic debut at Milano Cortina 2026 began with the sprint classic qualification, where he finished 50th — below the threshold for the knockout rounds. For a 22-year-old at his first Games, this result represents experience gained rather than opportunity lost. The Team Sprint Freestyle is where Slovenia expects to show their best face, and where Štern's partnership with Šimenc has been most productive.

Slovenia's sprint program under Hattestad — himself a sprint specialist who won the 2010 Vancouver Olympic sprint gold — has deliberately invested in developing sprint-specific technical skills, particularly in the skating technique. Štern's selection for the freestyle team sprint ahead of the classic format suggests his skate ability is considered his stronger suit.
