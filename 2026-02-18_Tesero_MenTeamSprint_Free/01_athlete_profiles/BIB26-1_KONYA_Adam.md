## Personal Background
Born December 19, 1992, in Hungary. Kónya is Hungary's defining cross-country skier of the modern era — a three-time Olympian and Olympic flagbearer who has kept cross-country skiing on Hungary's radar as a competitive discipline despite the country having almost no snowfall in most years. His off-snow training regimen — [rollerblade training on public Hungarian roads](https://hungary.news-pravda.com/en/hungary/2025/12/01/28317.html) — is a testament to the dedication required from athletes in non-traditional ski nations. He is a leadership figure within Hungarian winter sport more broadly.

## Key Storylines
Kónya's third Olympics at age 33 as Hungary's most experienced winter Olympian is a significant personal achievement. His Olympic Closing Ceremony flagbearing role at Beijing 2022 reflects his stature in Hungarian sport beyond results. The rollerblade-on-roads training story became a widely-shared pre-Games narrative about athlete dedication in non-traditional ski nations.

**Pairing note:** Kónya provides three-time Olympic experience and World Championship relay top-20 credentials to Hungary's team sprint. Paired with Büki, whose FIS points (303.24) reflect strong national and continental performance, Hungary brings an established senior duo. Kónya's relay knowledge and big-race tactical experience are valuable assets in the heats format.
