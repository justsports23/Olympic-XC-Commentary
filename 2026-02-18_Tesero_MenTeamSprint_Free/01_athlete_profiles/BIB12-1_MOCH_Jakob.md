## Key Storylines
Jakob Elias Moch is one of the youngest competitors in the entire Men's Team Sprint field. Born February 21, 2006, he turns 20 on the day after the Team Sprint (February 21) — so this race is effectively his last act as a teenager. He is competing at his first Olympic Games as a freshman at the University of Colorado ([CU Athletics — Moch named to German Olympic team](https://cubuffs.com/news/2026/1/20/skiing-cu-freshman-jakob-moch-named-to-german-olympic-team-for-2026-winter-games)). He became the 45th Olympian in CU ski history and the first to represent Germany ([CU Athletics — Moch named to German Olympic team](https://cubuffs.com/news/2026/1/20/skiing-cu-freshman-jakob-moch-named-to-german-olympic-team-for-2026-winter-games)). His Youth Olympic Games performance at Gangwon 2024 — 2 golds and a silver — established him as one of the most exciting junior prospects in world cross-country skiing ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/long-distance/karppelin-and-moch-interval-start-winners-at-the-youth-olympic-games/), [IOC Newsroom](https://newsroom.olympics.com/record/1386), [Olympics.com](https://olympics.com/en/gangwon-2024/video/men-s-free-sprint-cross-country-skiing-highlights-winter-youth-olympic-games-gan)). His World Cup debut at Davos in December 2025, where he finished 21st in the 10 km freestyle, was described as remarkable: he was the second-youngest competitor in the field and the youngest in the top 100 by two years ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=262901)). Paired with the more experienced Jan Stolben, Germany enters the Team Sprint as an up-and-coming nation rather than a medal contender, but with significant long-term potential in this pair.

**Pairing note:** Moch is one of the most compelling stories in this field — a teenager with a 2x YOG gold resume competing in his first Olympics ([CU Athletics](https://cubuffs.com/news/2026/1/20/skiing-cu-freshman-jakob-moch-named-to-german-olympic-team-for-2026-winter-games)). His explosive youth combined with Stolben's established World Cup sprint experience (6th at Tesero sprint classic in Tour de Ski) makes Germany a respectable qualifier. Watch Moch as a future Olympics star.
