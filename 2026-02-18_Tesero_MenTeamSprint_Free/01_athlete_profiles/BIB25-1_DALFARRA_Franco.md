## Personal Background
Born July 16, 2000, in Argentina. Dal Farra is the most internationally prominent Argentine male cross-country skier of his generation. Being named an Olympic flagbearer at Beijing 2022 at age 21 — sharing the honour with Francesca Baruzzi — reflects his standing in Argentine winter sport. Argentina's cross-country programme is based primarily in [San Carlos de Bariloche](https://barilocheturismo.gob.ar/en/ski-and-snow) in Patagonia, where the Andes mountains provide high-altitude training terrain. Full personal biography details beyond Olympic and FIS records are [DATA NOT FOUND] in available English-language sources.

## Key Storylines
Dal Farra and Sauma have raced together as a team sprint pair — their 26th at Planica 2023 is a remarkable result for a South American team sprint duo. As Olympic flagbearer at 21, Dal Farra carries the weight of Argentine winter sport visibility. His two Olympics, four World Championships, and established pairing chemistry with Sauma give Argentina a legitimate foundation.

**Pairing note:** Dal Farra and Sauma's shared Planica 2023 team sprint result (26th — best South American result) demonstrates real team sprint chemistry. Dal Farra provides the senior anchor experience as a two-time Olympian and Olympic flagbearer; Sauma's Bariloche background and Youth Olympic participation add the youth component. Argentina's team sprint pairing is more established than their BIB number suggests.
