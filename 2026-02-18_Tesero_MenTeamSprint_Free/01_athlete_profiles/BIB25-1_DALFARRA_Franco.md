## Personal Background
Born July 16, 2000, in Argentina ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=202419)). Dal Farra is the most internationally prominent Argentine male cross-country skier of his generation. Being named an Olympic flagbearer at Beijing 2022 at age 21 — sharing the honour with Francesca Baruzzi — reflects his standing in Argentine winter sport ([Argentina at the 2022 Winter Olympics — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics)). Argentina's cross-country programme is based primarily in San Carlos de Bariloche in Patagonia, where the Andes mountains provide high-altitude training terrain [UNVERIFIED]. Full personal biography details beyond Olympic and FIS records are [DATA NOT FOUND] in available English-language sources.

## Training Base

## Key Storylines
Dal Farra and Sauma have raced together as a team sprint pair — their 26th at Planica 2023 is a remarkable result for a South American team sprint duo ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/franco-dal-farra-cross-country-skiing-spf475755.html)). As Olympic flagbearer at 21, Dal Farra carries the weight of Argentine winter sport visibility ([Argentina at the 2022 Winter Olympics — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics)). His two Olympics, four World Championships, and established pairing chemistry with Sauma give Argentina a legitimate foundation ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/franco-dal-farra)).

**Pairing note:** Dal Farra and Sauma's shared Planica 2023 team sprint result (26th — best South American result) demonstrates real team sprint chemistry ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/franco-dal-farra-cross-country-skiing-spf475755.html)). Dal Farra provides the senior anchor experience as a two-time Olympian and Olympic flagbearer; Sauma's Bariloche background and Youth Olympic participation add the youth component. Argentina's team sprint pairing is more established than their BIB number suggests.
