## Key Storylines
Einar Hedegart is arguably the most remarkable story of the 2026 Winter Olympics. A top-30 biathlon World Cup competitor and three-time biathlon World Junior medallist ([IBU](https://www.biathlonworld.com/athlete/hedegart-einar/BTNOR10811200101)), he made the extraordinary decision in November 2025 to abandon biathlon and dedicate himself entirely to cross-country skiing ahead of the Milano Cortina Games ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/einar-hedegart-has-only-been-a-cross-country-skier-since-november-on-friday-he-could-dethrone-the-sports-olympic-king/)). His rationale: he had been losing in biathlon primarily due to shooting, not skiing, and his raw skiing speed was world-class ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-einar-hedegart-the-ex-biathlete-who-can-deny-johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-an-olympic-grand-slam-0212/)). The gamble paid off immediately — in his very first cross-country-only season he won three of six World Cup races, beating Klaebo, Amundsen, and France's best in the process ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/a-star-is-born-hedegart-beats-norway-s-best-for-first-world-cup-win)). He entered the 2026 Olympics having never lost to Klaebo in freestyle skiing ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-einar-hedegart-stumbles-on-klaeb-its-the-first-time-hes-beaten-me-0213/)). That record ended at the Olympic 10km, where Klaebo's superior tactical experience on the final climb denied Hedegart gold, but bronze was still a historic debut ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-einar-hedegart-stumbles-on-klaeb-its-the-first-time-hes-beaten-me-0213/)). The relay gold, shared with Klaebo and teammates, confirmed Norway's dominance in the 2026 Games ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42239)).

At just 24 years old in his first full cross-country season, Hedegart is entering the Men's Team Sprint as arguably Norway's strongest available distance skier. His partnership with Klaebo (the best relay skier in the world) makes BIB 01 the overwhelming favourite.

Growing up in the Trondheim region, Hedegart watched Petter Northug on television as a child ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-einar-hedegart-the-ex-biathlete-who-can-deny-johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-an-olympic-grand-slam-0212/)). He made the decision to leave biathlon after competing in parallel biathlon and cross-country races over two weekends at the start of the 2025-26 season. In biathlon he shot poorly — missing eight of 20 shots in one race — while in cross-country he won by a large margin ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/einar-hedegart-has-only-been-a-cross-country-skier-since-november-on-friday-he-could-dethrone-the-sports-olympic-king/)). The choice became clear. His coach Emil Hosøy guided the technical and tactical transition that followed ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/how-hedegart-trained-his-way-to-olympic-gold/)).

**Pairing note:** Hedegart's raw power and sustained aerobic engine from a decade of biathlon training complements Klaebo's unmatched sprint speed and tactical intelligence. Hedegart can open hard and hold pace; Klaebo finishes. This is the most feared combination in the field.
