## Personal Background
Born December 13, 2003, in Latvia ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=234409)). Kaparkalējs uses [Fischer](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=234409) equipment (skis and boots) and One Way poles, per FIS equipment records ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=234409)). His EYOF 2022 win in Vuokatti, Finland, made him a national sport hero in Latvia and placed him among the country's most-followed winter athletes ([EYOF 2022](https://eyof2022.fi/while-ericsson-and-naslund-keep-the-medals-coming-for-sweden-lauris-kaparkalejs-ensures-first-ever-cross-country-gold-medal-for-latvia-at-eyof/)). He is part of Latvia's strongest-ever men's cross-country sprint programme ([LSM.lv](https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/sport/20.01.2026-biggest-ever-latvian-winter-olympic-team-picked.a630669/)).

## Equipment
- **Skis:** Fischer ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=234409))
- **Boots:** Fischer ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=234409))

## Key Storylines
The EYOF gold at Vuokatti remains the landmark result for Latvian youth cross-country ([EYOF 2022](https://eyof2022.fi/while-ericsson-and-naslund-keep-the-medals-coming-for-sweden-lauris-kaparkalejs-ensures-first-ever-cross-country-gold-medal-for-latvia-at-eyof/)). His rollerski Junior World title adds further confirmation that his sprint speed is genuine on any surface [UNVERIFIED]. Now 22 and on the senior World Cup circuit, the trajectory toward top-15 finishes looks credible.

**Pairing note:** Kaparkalējs's raw sprint speed and youth energy pair with Vigants's proven Olympic sprint experience — Vigants was 20th in the Beijing 2022 sprint ([Wikipedia — Raimo Vīgants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raimo_V%C4%ABgants)), demonstrating final-level capacity — to give Latvia one of the most balanced team sprint pairings in BIBs 16-27.
