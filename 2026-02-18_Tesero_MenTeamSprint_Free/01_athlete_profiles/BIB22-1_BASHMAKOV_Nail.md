## Key Storylines
At 30, Bashmakov's Olympic debut is a late one, but his credentials are genuine: a Lahti top-10 sprint finish ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=191879)) and an Oberstdorf 2021 relay 12th ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=191879)) position him as Kazakhstan's most credentialed male sprinter entering these Games. His debut at age 30 makes his preparation all the more calculated.

**Pairing note:** Bashmakov (sprint World Cup top-10 veteran) paired with the 20-year-old Muratbekov forms a significant age gap pairing. Bashmakov brings the sprint experience and race-reading ability; Muratbekov brings youth, a 43rd Olympic interval start result at age 20, and back-to-back Junior Worlds 13th-place finishes ([Qazinform](https://qazinform.com/news/2026-winter-olympics-kazakhstan-reveals-its-full-roster-445b71)). Kazakhstan's team sprint capacity is meaningful, not nominal.
