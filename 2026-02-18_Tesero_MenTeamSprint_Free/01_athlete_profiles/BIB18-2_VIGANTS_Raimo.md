## Key Storylines
Vīgants's 20th-place finish in the sprint free at Beijing 2022 is one of the most impressive individual cross-country results Latvia has produced at an Olympic Games ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raimo_V%C4%ABgants)), and it came in a direct sprint format that mirrors the team sprint. That experience makes him the tactical anchor of Latvia's team sprint.

**Pairing note:** Vīgants brings proven Olympic sprint final experience alongside the speedier young Kaparkalējs. The pairing combines Kaparkalējs's explosive youth and EYOF-gold-level sprint power with Vīgants's demonstrated big-race composure — an ideal balance for the alternating-leg team sprint format.
