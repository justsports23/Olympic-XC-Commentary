## Key Storylines
Himma is the defining figure in Estonian men's cross-country skiing. His flagbearer role at Beijing 2022 reflects the esteem in which he is held nationally ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/martin-himma)). The 11th-place team sprint at Beijing remains Estonia's best men's Olympic team sprint result ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Himma)), and he returns to Milano Cortina aiming to improve on that benchmark.

**Pairing note:** Himma is the experienced anchor for Estonia's team sprint duo. His Olympic big-race composure and World Cup top-10 sprint experience provide the ceiling for this pairing, while the younger Dremljuga brings energy and complementary sprint speed on the opening legs.
