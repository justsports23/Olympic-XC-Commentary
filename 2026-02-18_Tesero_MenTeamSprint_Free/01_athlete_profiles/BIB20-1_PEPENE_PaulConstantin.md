## Personal Background
Pepene was born May 21, 1988 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Constantin_Pepene)), and has been Romania's defining cross-country skiing figure for more than a decade and a half. Carrying his country's flag in the Beijing 2022 Opening Ceremony ([Romania at the 2022 Winter Olympics — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics)) and again at the Predazzo venue ceremony at Milano Cortina 2026 ([Romania at the 2026 Winter Olympics — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics)) represents an extraordinary honour given twice. His longevity — competing at age 37 in a fifth Olympics — makes him one of the elder statesmen of the cross-country sprint field. His 2010 U23 World Championship win in the pursuit ([Olympics Fandom Wiki](https://olympics.fandom.com/wiki/Paul_Constantin_Pepene)) underlines that his career foundation was built on genuine distance speed, and his pivot toward team sprint events in the later stages of his career reflects tactical wisdom.

## Key Storylines
Pepene's presence at a fifth Winter Olympics at age 37 as a double Olympic flagbearer is among the most compelling personal narratives in these Games' cross-country field ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Constantin_Pepene)). His PyeongChang 2018 team sprint 15th — Romania's strongest modern team sprint Olympic result — is the benchmark he brings to this pairing ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Constantin_Pepene)).

**Pairing note:** The intergenerational Romania pairing of Pepene (37) and Cojocaru (~22) is among the largest age gaps in this field. Pepene brings irreplaceable Olympic experience and team sprint tactical knowledge; Cojocaru brings the fresh legs and competitive hunger. Their combined best — World Championships relay top-20 appearances and a team sprint history — makes them a dark-horse qualifier.
