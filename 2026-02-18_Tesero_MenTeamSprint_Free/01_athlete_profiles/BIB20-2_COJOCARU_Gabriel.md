## Key Storylines
Cojocaru's Olympic debut comes in partnership with Paul Pepene, one of the most experienced cross-country skiers in Romanian history ([Romania at the 2026 Winter Olympics — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics)). This pairing — with roughly 15 years between them — symbolises Romania's determination to maintain continuity in the sport while building the next generation. His 18th at Trondheim 2025 in the relay shows he can perform at championship level ([FIS Athlete Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=240731)).

**Pairing note:** Cojocaru provides the youth and physical freshness in Romania's team sprint. Partnered with Pepene's two-time Olympic flagbearer experience and championship team sprint track record (15th at PyeongChang 2018) ([Wikipedia — Paul Constantin Pepene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Constantin_Pepene)), Cojocaru's role is to execute consistent, clean legs without tactical errors — while Pepene handles the pressure moments.
