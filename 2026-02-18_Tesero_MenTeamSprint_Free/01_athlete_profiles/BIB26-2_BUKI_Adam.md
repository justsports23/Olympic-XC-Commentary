## Personal Background
Born May 24, 1995, in Hungary. Full biographical details including hometown, club, and training base are [DATA NOT FOUND] in available English-language sources beyond FIS records. Like his teammate Kónya, Büki has pursued an elite cross-country skiing career in Hungary, a country without significant natural snow, requiring dedicated off-season training on dry-land alternatives. His four World Championships participations over an eight-year span (2017–2025) reflect long-term commitment to the national programme.

## Training Base
Hungary (rollerblade/dry-land off-snow training); European on-snow training blocks during winter season.

## Key Storylines
Büki's Olympic debut at 30 reflects the gradual development pathway available to skiers in non-traditional nations — four World Championships without an Olympic appearance before finally earning the Games qualification. His relay-proven track record (Oberstdorf 2021 relay 16th with Kónya) means this is a pair with established working chemistry at championship level.

**Pairing note:** Büki and Kónya's shared Oberstdorf 2021 relay experience is the key asset for Hungary's team sprint — they know how to ski together in a high-pressure alternating format. Büki's similar World Cup career bests to Kónya suggest well-matched physical levels, while Kónya's three Olympics gives the pairing crucial experience advantage.
