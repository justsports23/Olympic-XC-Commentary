## Key Storylines
Michal Novák is the Czech Republic's most capped and experienced cross-country skier in sprint events. At the 2023 World Championships in Planica, he came agonisingly close to a medal when he finished 4th in the men's sprint classic — the Czech Republic's best performance in that event. He has appeared at five World Championships and three Olympics, bringing deep institutional knowledge to the Czech team.

Partnering with the mercurial young Jiří Tuž, Novák provides the Czech pair with a veteran anchor. While his World Cup results have been limited in quantity (one podium, a 2nd in a 20km mass start), his consistency in sprint formats over many years and his familiarity with Olympic-level competition are invaluable. The 2025 World Championships team sprint 7th place with Tuž showed the two can work well together.

At 29, Novák is in the prime of a sprint specialist's career. The Olympic relay 7th place (February 15) gives him recent competitive data from Tesero. The Team Sprint Freestyle is the Czech Republic's clearest medal opportunity at these Games.

**Pairing note:** Novák provides the steady, experienced hand that Tuž's brilliance needs. Having raced 5 World Championships and 3 Olympics, he understands how to conserve in heats and deliver in finals. His appendicitis surgery in October 2025 made his Olympic selection story one of resilience; making the team sprint final would be a remarkable comeback narrative.
