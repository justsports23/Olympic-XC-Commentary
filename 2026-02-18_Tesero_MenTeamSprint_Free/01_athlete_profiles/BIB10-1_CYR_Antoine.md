## Key Storylines
Antoine Cyr grew up 400 metres from Gatineau Park in Quebec, where both his parents were cross-country skiers, giving him constant access to ski trails from an early age ([Team Canada — competitive personality profile](https://olympic.ca/2024/10/22/i-have-a-super-competitive-personality-cross-country-skier-antoine-cyr-has-big-goals-for-2024-25-and-beyond/)). His inspiration was training alongside Canadian star Alex Harvey [UNVERIFIED]. His philosophy — "If you have fun you will go fast" — reflects his approach to competition ([Team Canada — competitive personality profile](https://olympic.ca/2024/10/22/i-have-a-super-competitive-personality-cross-country-skier-antoine-cyr-has-big-goals-for-2024-25-and-beyond/)). He has been the cornerstone of Canada's surge to medal contention in team formats: his 2022 Olympic team sprint result (5th, classic) and 2023 World Championship team sprint result (4th, freestyle) are the best Canada has ever achieved in these events ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/antoine-cyr/)). The relay 5th at Milano Cortina 2026 continued this trajectory ([Team Canada — relay 5th place](https://olympic.ca/2026/02/15/something-special-team-canada-earns-best-ever-olympic-result-in-cross-country-skiing-relay/)). Working with young partner Xavier McKeever, Cyr brings experienced and consistent skiing to a Canadian team that is punching above its weight internationally. His coaches are Louis Bouchard and François Pépin ([Team Canada — competitive personality profile](https://olympic.ca/2024/10/22/i-have-a-super-competitive-personality-cross-country-skier-antoine-cyr-has-big-goals-for-2024-25-and-beyond/)). Outside skiing he works as a mechanic at a bike shop [UNVERIFIED]. He trains at the Centre National d'entrainement Pierre Harvey in Quebec ([Nordiq Canada](https://nordiqcanada.ca/athlete/antoine-cyr/)).

**Pairing note:** Cyr is Canada's most experienced team sprint skier ever — 5th twice, 4th once, at the highest levels in this format ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/antoine-cyr/)). McKeever adds explosive sprint freestyle speed. The combination of Cyr's team-format IQ and McKeever's youth and power gives Canada a credible qualification contender.
