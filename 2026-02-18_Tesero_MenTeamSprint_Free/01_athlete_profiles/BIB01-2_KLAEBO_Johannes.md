## Key Storylines
Johannes Høsflot Klæbo is the greatest cross-country skier in history by virtually every measurable standard ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-becomes-most-decorated-cross-country-skier-of-all-time)). At the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim — held on home snow in front of his home crowd — he won all six events he entered, becoming the most decorated male skier in World Championship history with 15 gold medals, surpassing compatriot Petter Northug's 13 ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-becomes-most-decorated-cross-country-skier-of-all-time)). At the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics he has already won four gold medals in four events — skiathlon, sprint, 10km free, and relay — to bring his Olympic total to 9, setting a new all-time Winter Olympics gold medal record and surpassing Norwegian speed skater Oscar Mathisen and Bjørn Dæhlie ([ESPN](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/47936580/johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-wins-9th-olympic-gold-medal-cross-country-skiing); [CBC Sports](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/cross-country-skiing/norwegian-klaebo-ties-all-time-winter-olympics-gold-record-9.7088128)).

Entering the Team Sprint Freestyle, Klæbo is gunning for his 10th Olympic gold and 5th medal at these Games ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42284)). The team sprint is a format he has dominated for nearly a decade: he holds two Olympic team sprint golds (2018, shared; 2026 relay is separate) and four World Championship team sprint golds ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-becomes-most-decorated-cross-country-skier-of-all-time)). His combination with first-Olympics partner Hedegart gives Norway a nearly insurmountable edge.

His grandfather Kåre Høsflot is his longtime coach; his father Haakon Klæbo is his manager ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/from-trondheim-trails-to-the-olympic-all-time-throne-klaebo-s-journey-to-greatness)). He has lived and trained in Trondheim his entire career. Klæbo has also built a substantial personal brand and media presence — he runs a popular vlog documenting his training and racing life, which has contributed to making him one of the most commercially successful cross-country skiers in history ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_H%C3%B8sflot_Kl%C3%A6bo)). He trained at a facility near Salt Lake City, Utah, in the pre-Olympic period, combining altitude work with low-profile preparation [UNVERIFIED]. He represents Byåsen IL, the Trondheim club where he began ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_H%C3%B8sflot_Kl%C3%A6bo)).

**Pairing note:** Klaebo is the world's greatest team sprint finisher — a proven closer who elevates whatever partner he races alongside. With Hedegart providing consistent, high-powered laps, Norway's rotation gives each man time to recover between their three laps. This is the best-prepared and most dangerous pair in the field.
