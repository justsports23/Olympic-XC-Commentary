## Technique & Format Profile

- **Distance preference:** Sprint specialist; team sprint and relay legs are his strength
- **Best format:** Team sprint and relay legs; tactical team skiing
- **Climbing ability:** Sufficient for sprint lap format at Tesero

## Key Storylines
Carl Johan Haggstrom is the elder statesman of the Swedish sprint team at 33 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_H%C3%A4ggstr%C3%B6m)). Added to the Swedish Olympic squad as one of the final selections in January 2026 ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/complete-swedish-cross-country-skiing-team-confirmed-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)), he was chosen specifically for his experience in team-format skiing and his reliability in high-pressure situations. In the individual sprint classic on February 10, he qualified 30th — the very last qualification spot — and was eliminated in the quarterfinals. This was a minor setback but his main assignment was always the Team Sprint Freestyle.

Pairing with the younger and more explosive Edvin Anger gives Sweden a complementary combination: Haggstrom's tactical wisdom and Anger's raw speed. Sweden won Olympic gold in this event through Haggstrom and Linn Svahn in a notable photo at Tesero on February 10 (the women's team sprint) [UNVERIFIED — photo context], and the men's team is motivated to replicate that success ([Alamy](https://www.alamy.com/val-di-fiemme-italy-20260210-linn-svahn-from-sweden-and-johan-hggstrm-from-sweden-celebrate-after-winning-gold-in-the-cross-country-sprint-final-at-lago-di-tesero-during-the-winter-olympics-in-milano-cortina-2026-photo-lise-serud-ntb-this-text-is-auto-translated-image719093784.html)).

His career eight World Cup podiums — including relay and team sprint legs — demonstrate consistent high-level performance across many years ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_H%C3%A4ggstr%C3%B6m)). At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the Swedish relay team narrowly missed a medal in 4th ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_H%C3%A4ggstr%C3%B6m)). The 2026 Games represents his final major opportunity at an Olympic team medal.

On February 10, Haggstrom was part of a historic moment at Tesero: he and Linn Svahn celebrated after Svahn's individual sprint gold ([Alamy](https://www.alamy.com/val-di-fiemme-italy-20260210-linn-svahn-from-sweden-and-johan-hggstrm-from-sweden-celebrate-after-winning-gold-in-the-cross-country-sprint-final-at-lago-di-tesero-during-the-winter-olympics-in-milano-cortina-2026-photo-lise-serud-ntb-this-text-is-auto-translated-image719093784.html)). The men's team sprint gives the pair a chance to add to Sweden's medal count at these Games ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics)).

**Pairing note:** Haggstrom is Sweden's tactical executor — a calm, experienced presence who can manage heat racing and set up Anger for the critical final lap exchange. At 33, he is the oldest man in Sweden's sprint squad and brings an irreplaceable perspective on managing effort across multiple rounds of a team sprint competition.
