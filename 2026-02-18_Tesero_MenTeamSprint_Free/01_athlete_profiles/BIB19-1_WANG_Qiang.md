## Key Storylines
At 32, Wang Qiang is in the final phase of a landmark career. The historic Drammen podium will endure as the defining moment of Chinese men's cross-country ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2022/03/after-a-week-of-upheavals-the-world-cup-sprint-show-goes-on-in-drammen-frances-jouve-wins-while-china-gets-its-first-podium/)). His 2025-26 form shows continued presence in final-round sprint competition ([FIS Results — Goms](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=CC&raceid=49499)), and his pairing with the younger Li Minglin gives China genuine team sprint capability for the first time at an Olympics.

**Pairing note:** Wang Qiang is the unquestioned leader of this Chinese pairing — a proven World Cup podium finisher with Olympic sprint final experience ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Qiang_(skier))). He carries the creative attacking capacity for China's team sprint, with Li Minglin providing the support and distance legs. China's result in this event may ultimately depend on how much of Drammen-2022 Wang Qiang can summon.
