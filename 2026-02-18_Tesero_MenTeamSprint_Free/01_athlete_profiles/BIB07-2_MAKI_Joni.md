## Key Storylines
Joni Mäki is one of the most accomplished team sprint specialists in the history of cross-country skiing. He has won a medal at the World Championships in team sprint free (silver, 2021 Oberstdorf, with Iivo Niskanen) and Olympic silver in team sprint classic (2022 Beijing) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_M%C3%A4ki)). The team sprint is undeniably his best format — his individual World Cup results (3 podiums total) are modest compared to his team-format excellence ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_M%C3%A4ki)).

Particularly significant is his connection to the Tesero venue: he won his first major career medal here at the 2014 Junior Worlds, a bronze in the sprint classic ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/val-di-fiemme-back-in-olympic-spotlight-with-finland-aiming-high/)). Now 31 and in his second Olympics, he returns to this exact course with a chance at the ultimate prize. Pairing with Lauri Vuorinen — who just won World Championship sprint free bronze in 2025 and narrowly missed Olympic sprint classic bronze on February 10 — gives Finland arguably the most cohesive and experienced team sprint pairing in the field ([ProXCskiing — Olympics 2026 Men's Team Sprint complete guide](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-team-sprint/)).

The Finnish team's motivation will be further sharpened by the controversial near-miss in the individual sprint on February 10, where Vuorinen finished 4th and Finland filed a formal protest over waxing procedures [UNVERIFIED — see Vuorinen profile for sources]. The team sprint is a chance to achieve what individual events narrowly denied.

**Pairing note:** Mäki is the team sprint specialist's specialist — more team sprint medals than almost anyone at this Olympics, more experience in the format, and a course connection at Tesero dating back to his 2014 Junior Worlds bronze here ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/val-di-fiemme-back-in-olympic-spotlight-with-finland-aiming-high/)). With Vuorinen providing individual sprint bronze (Worlds 2025) speed, Finland has one of the deepest duos in the field ([ProXCskiing — Olympics 2026 Men's Team Sprint complete guide](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-team-sprint/)). They should be in the final.
