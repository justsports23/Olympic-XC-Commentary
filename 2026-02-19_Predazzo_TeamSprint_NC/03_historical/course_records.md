**Note:** The 2026 Olympic configuration uses HS 104 (Large Hill), which is a different hill profile than the HS 134-143 used for World Cups and World Championships. Records from the larger hill are not directly comparable.

## Important Caveats

1. **Hill configuration change:** The 2026 Olympics use HS 104, not the HS 134-143 used in previous WC/WCh events. Jumping records from prior events are not directly comparable.
2. **Course modifications:** The XC course may have been modified since the last NC event at Tesero (2022). Course renovations for the Olympics may affect comparability.
3. **No recent data:** The 2024-25 WC event at Val di Fiemme was cancelled due to hill reconstruction, meaning the last NC competition data from this venue is from January 2022.
4. **Conditions vary:** Course records in XC skiing are heavily influenced by snow conditions, temperature, and wax — they are less meaningful than in track athletics.
