# Podium Contenders — Nordic Combined Team Sprint LH/2x7.5km
## Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics | Predazzo, 19 February 2026

---

## 1. NORWAY (BIB 12) — Andreas Skoglund / Jens Luraas Oftebro ⭐ GOLD FAVORITE

**Why they win:**
- Jens Luraas Oftebro is the **dominant athlete in Nordic Combined today** — 3 Olympic golds at these Games (NH individual, LH individual, team event), reigning WC Overall champion (2024-25), and the best cross-country skier in the field
- Oftebro overcame a 22-second jumping deficit to win the LH individual by 5.9 seconds — his XC ability is unmatched
- Skoglund provides solid support: two 4th-place finishes in the individual events demonstrate he belongs among the elite; breakout season with 2 WC podiums (Otepää 3rd, Seefeld 3rd)
- Norway's XC depth is overwhelming — even if their jumping is merely adequate, Oftebro can make up virtually any gap on the track

**Risk factors:**
- Skoglund's jumping has been inconsistent (DSQ at Ruka for suit violation early in season)
- Skoglund has no proven Team Sprint pedigree — his two Olympic 4ths were in individual events
- If Austria or Germany build a 30+ second lead after jumping, even Oftebro will need Skoglund to hold his own on XC legs

**Predicted role:** Norway starts within 10-15 seconds of the leaders after jumping and Oftebro reels them in during the XC sprint. Skoglund needs to avoid losing too much time on his legs.

## 2. AUSTRIA (BIB 14) — Stefan Rettenegger / Johannes Lamparter ⭐ MAIN CHALLENGER

**Why they medal:**
- Johannes Lamparter is a **double Olympic silver medalist** at these Games (+1.0s NH, +5.9s LH behind Oftebro), currently leading the 2025-26 World Cup overall standings with 5 wins, and 2022-23 Crystal Globe winner
- Lamparter is a **2021 World Championship Team Sprint gold medalist** — proven in this exact format
- Rettenegger is an elite ski jumper — won the Seefeld compact jump, among "the best jumpers in the field" — giving Austria a potential lead after the jumping phase
- Rettenegger has 16 WC podiums and was 2023-24 WC Overall runner-up — enormous talent
- Combined, Austria may have the strongest aggregate jumping + XC balance of any team

**Risk factors:**
- Rettenegger's **16 WC podiums without a single win** — historically struggles to convert leads under pressure (Seefeld: 9.8-point jump lead, lost to Oftebro by 3.7s)
- Rettenegger's Olympic form was inconsistent: 4th in NH (+17s) then 11th in LH (+1:08)
- Lamparter's two Olympic silvers were both losses to Oftebro — psychological edge may favor Norway

**Predicted role:** Austria builds a solid lead through jumping (Rettenegger especially) and Lamparter defends it on the track. If Lamparter is on the same XC leg as Oftebro in the final kilometers, history suggests Oftebro wins the sprint.

## 3. GERMANY (BIB 13) — Johannes Rydzek / Vinzenz Geiger ⭐ STRONG MEDAL CONTENDER

**Why they medal:**
- **Two of the most decorated athletes in NC history** combined on one team
- Rydzek: 14 World Championship medals (7 gold), 4 Olympic medals, Holmenkollen Medal recipient, 69 WC podiums, **2017 World Championship Team Sprint gold medalist**
- Geiger: 2024-25 World Cup Overall Champion (Crystal Globe), Beijing 2022 Olympic individual gold (dramatic rally from 11th), **67 WC podiums (22 wins)**
- Geiger's first-ever WC win came at Val di Fiemme — special connection to this venue
- Both athletes from SC 1906 Oberstdorf — exceptional chemistry and familiarity
- Rydzek's 2017 Lahti grand slam (4/4 golds) remains unprecedented — he knows how to win team sprints at the highest level

**Risk factors:**
- Geiger came back from torn foot ligaments (autumn 2025) — missed Ruka/Trondheim; felt unwell in final 1.8km of Olympic NH event (10th place)
- Rydzek is 34 years old — questions about late-race XC power against younger rivals
- Geiger's Olympic form (10th) is below his standard — fitness question remains after injury

**Predicted role:** Germany's elite jumping keeps them in the hunt, and their enormous experience in team formats is their edge. If Geiger's health holds, this team can challenge for gold. If Geiger fades, bronze is the target.

## 4. FINLAND (BIB 11) — Eero Hirvonen / Ilkka Herola ⭐ DARK HORSE FOR GOLD, LIKELY MEDALIST

**Why they medal:**
- **THE proven Team Sprint duo** — won the WC Team Sprint together at Lahti 2019 by 0.2 seconds over Norway
- Both athletes are **Olympic bronze medalists from these Games**: Hirvonen (NH/10km bronze, ending Finland's 20-year NC medal drought) and Herola (LH/10km bronze, +14.8s)
- Both are elite cross-country skiers: Hirvonen rose from 31st to 9th at Trondheim on XC alone; Herola won his maiden WC at Oslo with a hill-record 146m jump AND 34-second victory margin
- They are riding a wave of Olympic medal confidence — both peaked at exactly the right moment
- Herola has 21 WC podiums and genuine ski jumping strength (hill records); Hirvonen is a Finnish National Champion

**Risk factors:**
- Neither is among the strongest individual jumpers in the field — they need to limit the jumping deficit to ~20 seconds
- Hirvonen's jumping is adequate but not elite — could hand too much time to Austria/Germany in the SJ phase
- Finland lacks the sheer star power of Oftebro or Lamparter — need everything to go right

**Predicted role:** Finland starts 15-25 seconds behind the top jumping teams but their proven Team Sprint chemistry and elite XC ability allows them to surge through the field. They know how to race as a pair — Lahti 2019 proves it. This could be the team that surprises everyone for gold.

## 5. JAPAN (BIB 10) — Akito Watabe / Ryota Yamamoto — OUTSIDE MEDAL CHANCE

**Why they could medal:**
- Watabe is a **living legend**: 6-time Olympian, 79 WC podiums, 2017-18 Crystal Globe winner, 4 Olympic medals (2 silver, 2 bronze) — in his retirement season, could summon one final great performance
- Yamamoto is an **elite-level ski jumper** who regularly leads after the jumping phase (led Olympic LH jumping at Milano Cortina, won Ramsau SJ round) — Japan could start XC with a significant lead
- Watabe/Yamamoto have extensive partnership experience across multiple team events including Beijing 2022 team bronze
- Emotional storyline: Watabe's final competitive event ever, the last NC Olympic event ever — maximum motivation

**Risk factors:**
- Watabe is 37 and declining: 11th (NH) and 19th (LH) at these Olympics — no longer competing at his peak XC level
- Yamamoto regularly loses significant positions during XC — elite jumping but moderate cross-country ability
- Both athletes' XC weakness is a critical vulnerability against the pure XC power of Norway, Austria, Germany, and Finland

**Predicted role:** Japan's jumping could put them among the leaders going into XC, but they likely fade as the relay progresses. A medal requires an enormous jumping lead AND the favorites making mistakes on the track. Possible but unlikely — 5th-7th more realistic.
