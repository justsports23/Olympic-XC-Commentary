## FORMAT CONTEXT

The Team Sprint pairs each team of two athletes across **two disciplines**: a single ski jump each on the Predazzo Large Hill (HS 104, K-Point 95m) [(NBC Olympics)](https://nbcolympics.com/news/nordic-combined-101-venue), followed by a **2x7.5km cross-country sprint relay** where teammates alternate legs [(Start List)](00_race_info/start_list_raw.md). Combined jumping scores are converted to Gundersen time gaps — the strongest jumping team starts first, with all others chasing [(Race Overview)](00_race_info/race_overview.md). This is potentially the **final Nordic Combined event in Olympic history**, as the IOC has removed NC from the 2030 program [(Race Overview)](00_race_info/race_overview.md).

# TIER 1 — GOLD CONTENDERS

## PAIR 1: NORWAY (BIB 12) — Andreas Skoglund / Jens Luraas Oftebro

### The Pair Dynamic
Norway fields the **single most dominant athlete in the sport** alongside a breakout sophomore. This is a classic "superstar + support" pairing — Oftebro is the engine, Skoglund is the chassis that must not break down.

### Athlete 1: Andreas Skoglund (NOR)
- **Age:** 24 | **FIS Code:** 189544 [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=189544&type=result)

- **Age:** 25 | **FIS Code:** 182614 [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=NK&competitorid=182614)
- **Olympic form:** **3 GOLD MEDALS at these Games** — Individual NH/10km gold (+1.0s over Lamparter), Individual LH/10km gold (+5.9s over Lamparter), Team event gold, plus 1 silver [(Olympics.com NH)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/winter-olympics-2026-jens-luras-oftebro-unleashes-late-sprint-to-claim-nordic-combined-individual-gundersen-normal-hill-10km-gold) [(Olympics.com LH)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/winter-olympics-2026-jens-luras-oftebro-claims-second-gold-of-games-in-nordic-combined-individual-gundersen-large-hill-10km)

### Pair Chemistry Assessment
| Factor | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Combined SJ** | 7/10 | Skoglund strong, Oftebro mid-pack in SJ — gap likely manageable |
| **Combined XC** | 10/10 | Oftebro is THE best XC skier in NC; Skoglund is very strong |
| **Team Sprint experience** | 3/5 | Oftebro has team gold at these Games, but this specific pairing is unproven in TS format |
| **Balance** | Uneven | This pair lives or dies on Skoglund's ability to hold position during his legs while Oftebro does the damage |
| **Fatigue management** | Strong | Both under 25 — excellent recovery between sprint legs |

### Pair Strengths
1. **Oftebro's XC is an unfair advantage** — he overcame 22 seconds at the LH event and won by nearly 6 seconds [(NBC Olympics)](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/norways-jens-luraas-oftebro-goes-2-2-after-climbing-nordic-combined-large-hill-gold). No other team has an athlete who can single-handedly erase deficits like this.
2. **Youth and recovery** — At 24 and 25, both athletes are in prime physical condition for the repeated high-intensity sprint efforts this format demands.
3. **Momentum** — 3 golds and 1 silver at these Games creates supreme confidence [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42330).

### Pair Weaknesses
1. **Skoglund is the vulnerability** — his 2 WC podiums (both thirds) contrast sharply with Oftebro's 46 podiums. When Oftebro is resting during tag exchanges, Skoglund must match Rettenegger and Lamparter stride for stride — and he's never done that consistently [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=189544&type=result).
2. **Suit violation history** — Ruka DSQ shows equipment compliance risk, though unlikely to recur under Olympic scrutiny [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-seefeld-triple-stefan-rettenegger-after-the-compact-jump-the-best-cross-country-skiers-well-placed-0131/).
3. **No proven Team Sprint pedigree as a pair** — neither has a Team Sprint-specific result at WC or championship level together.

### Verdict: **GOLD FAVORITE**
Norway wins if the jumping gap stays under ~20 seconds. Oftebro's XC supremacy is the single greatest weapon any team has. The question is whether Skoglund can keep the ship steady on his rotations.

## PAIR 2: AUSTRIA (BIB 14) — Stefan Rettenegger / Johannes Lamparter

### The Pair Dynamic
Austria fields the most **balanced** pair in the competition — both athletes are legitimate top-10 individual performers, both can jump AND ski. Where Norway has a superstar and a supporter, Austria has two elite weapons firing on all cylinders.

### Athlete 1: Stefan Rettenegger (AUT)
- **Age:** 23 | **FIS Code:** 196343 [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=196343&type=result)
- **Olympic form:** 4th in NH/10km (+17s), 11th in LH/10km (+1:08) — inconsistent between events [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/19975)
- **Season form:** Won Seefeld compact jump; 2nd in Seefeld Gundersen (lost to Oftebro by 3.7s despite 9.8-point jumping lead); dominated Ruka XC mass start [(Nordic Mag Seefeld)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-seefeld-triple-stefan-rettenegger-to-lead-on-skis-on-the-gundersen-the-good-cross-country-skiers-grouped-together-0201/) [(Nordic Mag Ruka)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-ruka-stefan-rettenegger-dominates-the-cross-country-mass-start-edgar-vallet-best-frenchman-1130/)
- **Career defining stat:** **16 WC podiums — ZERO wins.** 9 runner-up finishes. The most prominent "nearly man" in current NC [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=196343&type=result)
- **Pressure concern:** Described his Seefeld loss as "lifelong dream shattered" — "Tut verdammt weh" (hurts like hell) [(SportNews.bz)](https://en.sportnews.bz/artikel/wintersport/nordische-kombination/lebenstraum-von-kombinierer-platzt-tut-verdammt-weh)
- **WCh medals:** 4 x Bronze — Mixed Team NH 2025, Individual Compact NH 2025, Team LH 2023, Mixed Team NH 2023 [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=196343&type=result)

### Athlete 2: Johannes Lamparter (AUT)

- **Olympic form:** **Double silver medalist** at these Games — 2nd NH/10km (+1.0s behind Oftebro), 2nd LH/10km (+5.9s behind Oftebro) [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/19966) [(Yahoo Sports)](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/oftebro-beats-lamparter-again-olympic-142828511.html)
- **Season dominance:** **Leading 2025-26 WC overall** with 5+ wins — Ruka Tour, Trondheim, Seefeld mass start, Otepää compact [(FIS Otepää)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/lamparter-dominates-otepaeae-compact-to-extend-overall-lead) [(FIS Ruka)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/lamparter-wins-nordic-combined-opener-in-ruka) [(FIS Seefeld)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/emotional-lamparter-begins-triple-bid-with-mass-start-win)

- **Equipment:** Fischer skis, Leki poles; Red Bull sponsored [(Red Bull)](https://www.redbull.com/int-en/athlete/johannes-lamparter)

### Pair Chemistry Assessment
| Factor | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Combined SJ** | 10/10 | Both elite jumpers — Rettenegger won Seefeld compact jump, Lamparter consistently builds leads [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-seefeld-triple-stefan-rettenegger-after-the-compact-jump-the-best-cross-country-skiers-well-placed-0131/) |
| **Combined XC** | 8/10 | Lamparter is elite; Rettenegger dominated Ruka XC mass start [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-ruka-stefan-rettenegger-dominates-the-cross-country-mass-start-edgar-vallet-best-frenchman-1130/) |
| **Team Sprint experience** | 4/5 | Lamparter won 2021 WC Team Sprint gold [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=209403&type=result) |
| **Balance** | Excellent | The most evenly matched pair among the contenders — no obvious weak link |
| **Fatigue management** | Excellent | 23 and 24 — youngest elite pair in the field |

### Pair Strengths
1. **Best combined jumping team** — both are among the strongest jumpers in the field, meaning Austria could start the XC sprint with a meaningful lead [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-seefeld-triple-stefan-rettenegger-after-the-compact-jump-the-best-cross-country-skiers-well-placed-0131/).
2. **Balance eliminates the weak-link problem** — in sprint relay, a weak link loses time every rotation. Austria has no weak link. Both can jump, both can ski.
3. **Lamparter's format experience** — 2021 WC Team Sprint gold means he knows exactly how to pace, when to push, and how to manage tag transitions [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=209403&type=result).
4. **Youngest contending pair** at 23+24 — superior recovery between sprint legs.

### Pair Weaknesses
1. **Rettenegger's inability to close** — 16 podiums, 0 wins. The Seefeld Gundersen is the cautionary tale: 9.8-point jumping lead, lost to Oftebro by 3.7s [(SportNews.bz)](https://en.sportnews.bz/artikel/wintersport/nordische-kombination/lebenstraum-von-kombinierer-platzt-tut-verdammt-weh). Under Olympic pressure, can he hold what Lamparter builds?
2. **Lamparter's Oftebro problem** — two Olympic silvers, both lost to the same man. Psychological edge favors Norway if it comes down to a direct Lamparter-Oftebro duel on the final leg [(Yahoo Sports)](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/oftebro-beats-lamparter-again-olympic-142828511.html).
3. **Rettenegger's inconsistency** — 4th in NH event, then 11th (+1:08) in LH event at these same Games. Which Rettenegger shows up? [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/19975)

### Verdict: **PRIMARY CHALLENGER — SILVER/GOLD**
Austria's strategy is build-and-defend: jump into the lead, have Lamparter match Oftebro stride for stride on XC. If Rettenegger holds his legs against Skoglund, Austria can absolutely win gold. The risk is that Rettenegger wilts under pressure — something his 0-win record suggests is possible.

## PAIR 3: GERMANY (BIB 13) — Johannes Rydzek / Vinzenz Geiger

### The Pair Dynamic
The **most decorated pair in the field by a massive margin** — a combined 136 WC podiums, 48 WC wins, 6 Olympic medals, and 22 World Championship medals. Two athletes from the same club (SC 1906 Oberstdorf) who have trained together for over a decade. This is experience personified.

### Athlete 1: Johannes Rydzek (GER)

- **Val di Fiemme connection:** Won his **FIRST EVER World Cup victory** at this venue (Jan 13, 2019, 26:34.0 — fastest XC time of the day) [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1074178/geiger-claims-maiden-nordic-combined-world-cup-win-in-val-di-fiemme) [(Ski Club Oberstdorf)](https://www.skiclub-oberstdorf.de/club/athleten/vinzenz-geiger.html)
- **CRITICAL FITNESS CONCERN:** Suffered torn foot ligaments in autumn 2025 — missed Ruka and Trondheim WC events [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-vinzenz-geiger-last-winters-globe-winner-will-not-take-part-in-the-ruka-and-trondheim-world-cups-due-to-a-foot-injury-1110). Won Seefeld Compact Triple on return [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-triple-in-seefeld-vinzenz-geiger-wins-after-a-sublime-sprint-on-the-compact-course-0131). But **felt unwell in the final 1.8km** of the Olympic NH event — finished 10th [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/nordic-combined-vinzenz-geiger-the-zen-warrior)
- **Equipment:** Atomic skis [(Atomic)](https://www.atomic.com/en/athletes/vinzenz-geiger)

### Pair Chemistry Assessment
| Factor | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Combined SJ** | 10/10 | Both elite, decades of experience at the highest level |
| **Combined XC** | 9/10 (if Geiger fit) | Geiger's Beijing rally (11th→1st) is the gold standard; Rydzek is a tactical master [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/vinzenz-geiger-wins-individual-gundersen-normal-hill-10km-gold) |
| **Team Sprint experience** | 5/5 | Rydzek won 2017 WC TS gold; **Rydzek+Geiger finished 2nd in the 2019 TS at THIS VENUE** [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1074178/geiger-claims-maiden-nordic-combined-world-cup-win-in-val-di-fiemme) |
| **Balance** | Excellent (if fit) | Two genuine stars — the question is Geiger's fitness, not his talent |
| **Training partnership** | Elite | Same club (SC 1906 Oberstdorf), same town, over a decade of daily training together [(Ski Club Oberstdorf)](https://www.skiclub-oberstdorf.de/club/athleten/vinzenz-geiger.html) |

### Pair Strengths
1. **Venue history as a pair** — Rydzek and Geiger finished 2nd in the 2019 WC Team Sprint at **this exact venue** (+0.5s behind Norway). They have raced this format on this course before [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1074178/geiger-claims-maiden-nordic-combined-world-cup-win-in-val-di-fiemme).
2. **Combined experience is unmatched** — 136 WC podiums, 48 wins, 22 WCh medals between them. No pair comes close. Under Olympic pressure, this experience is invaluable.
3. **Val di Fiemme is Geiger's breakthrough venue** — first WC win here. The familiarity and emotional connection could inspire [(Ski Club Oberstdorf)](https://www.skiclub-oberstdorf.de/club/athleten/vinzenz-geiger.html).
4. **Rydzek's team event mastery** — his 2017 grand slam included Team Sprint gold. He knows how to race this format at the highest level [(Axelent)](https://www.axelent.de/x-news-old/2017/historical-performance-at-the-world-championships-in-lahti-by-johannes-rydzek/).

### Pair Weaknesses
1. **Geiger's fitness is THE question mark** — torn foot ligaments, missed early-season events, then felt unwell at the Olympic NH event (10th). If he fades in later sprint legs, Germany drops from gold contender to bronze fight [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-vinzenz-geiger-last-winters-globe-winner-will-not-take-part-in-the-ruka-and-trondheim-world-cups-due-to-a-foot-injury-1110) [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/nordic-combined-vinzenz-geiger-the-zen-warrior).
2. **Age profile** — at 34 and 28, they are the oldest combined age among the contenders. Rydzek's late-race sprint power against 23-year-old Rettenegger and 25-year-old Oftebro is a concern.
3. **No Olympic medals at these Games** — while NOR has 3 golds and AUT has 2 silvers, Germany's best is Geiger's 10th. Momentum is not with them.

### Verdict: **STRONG MEDAL CONTENDER — GOLD IF GEIGER IS FIT**
Germany on paper has the strongest overall pair — unmatched experience, venue history as a team, and two genuine superstars. But Geiger's fitness is a 50/50 gamble. Healthy Geiger = gold threat. Fading Geiger = bronze fight.

## PAIR 4: FINLAND (BIB 11) — Eero Hirvonen / Ilkka Herola

### The Pair Dynamic
The **ONLY pair in this field with a proven Team Sprint victory together** — they won the WC Team Sprint at Lahti in 2019 by 0.2 seconds over Norway [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1075343/finnish-pairing-celebrates-team-sprint-success-at-fis-nordic-combined-world-cup-in-lahti) [(Fischer Sports)](https://www.fischersports.com/us_en/news/herolahirvonen-celebrate-home-victory-in-lahti).

### Pair Chemistry Assessment
| Factor | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Combined SJ** | 7/10 | Herola can produce huge jumps (146m hill record); Hirvonen is adequate but not elite |
| **Combined XC** | 10/10 | BOTH are elite XC skiers — Hirvonen 31st→9th at Trondheim; Herola won WC by 34 seconds |
| **Team Sprint experience** | 5/5 | **Won the 2019 WC Team Sprint together at Lahti by 0.2s** [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1075343/finnish-pairing-celebrates-team-sprint-success-at-fis-nordic-combined-world-cup-in-lahti) [(Fischer Sports)](https://www.fischersports.com/us_en/news/herolahirvonen-celebrate-home-victory-in-lahti) |
| **Balance** | Excellent | Both elite XC, both solid SJ — no weak link on the track |
| **Emotional momentum** | Off the charts | Both won Olympic bronze THIS WEEK — riding the highest wave of their careers |

### Pair Strengths
1. **The ONLY proven Team Sprint partnership in the field** — their 2019 Lahti victory (0.2s over Norway) proves they know how to race as a unit. Tag exchanges, pacing, tactical positioning — they've done it and won it [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1075343/finnish-pairing-celebrates-team-sprint-success-at-fis-nordic-combined-world-cup-in-lahti) [(Fischer Sports)](https://www.fischersports.com/us_en/news/herolahirvonen-celebrate-home-victory-in-lahti).
2. **Both are peaking simultaneously** — dual Olympic bronze medals within 6 days of each other. Their confidence and physical form are at career highs [(Finland Today)](https://finlandtoday.fi/eero-hirvonen-wins-finlands-first-medal-of-milan-cortina-olympics-with-bronze-in-nordic-combined/) [(Daily Finland)](https://www.dailyfinland.fi/sports/47881/Herola-wins-4th-medal-for-Finland-at-Milan-Cortina-Olympics).
3. **Both are elite XC skiers** — the sprint relay format rewards teams where BOTH athletes are strong on skis. Finland has no hiding place for a weak XC leg because there is no weak XC leg.
4. **At age 30, both in the "sweet spot"** — experienced enough to manage effort distribution, young enough to recover between sprint legs.

### Pair Weaknesses
1. **Jumping deficit** — Hirvonen is an adequate but not elite jumper. If the combined jumping score puts Finland 25+ seconds behind Austria/Germany, even their XC superiority may not fully bridge the gap.
2. **Lack of individual star power** — neither Hirvonen (11 WC podiums) nor Herola (21) matches the raw individual pedigree of Oftebro (46), Lamparter (62), or Geiger (67). In a pure speed contest on the final leg, they may be outgunned.
3. **Herola's record of near-misses** — 12 thirds in 21 WC podiums suggests he's frequently close but rarely the winner.

### Verdict: **DARK HORSE FOR GOLD — MOST LIKELY BRONZE, POSSIBLE GOLD**
Finland is THE most dangerous pair in the field if the jumping phase keeps them within 20 seconds of the lead. Their proven Team Sprint chemistry, dual XC elite status, and dual Olympic bronze momentum make them a genuine gold threat. The Lahti 2019 precedent — beating Norway by 0.2s — proves they can win this format.

# TIER 2 — MEDAL OUTSIDERS / TOP-8 CONTENDERS

## PAIR 5: JAPAN (BIB 10) — Akito Watabe / Ryota Yamamoto

### The Pair Dynamic
A **legend's farewell** paired with the field's most dangerous ski jumper. Japan is the ultimate "jump and hold" team — they need an enormous SJ lead and must defend it for 15km of XC. Their XC vulnerability is the trade-off.

- **Key weakness:** Regularly loses significant positions during XC phase — elite jumping but moderate cross-country ability [(NBC Olympics)](https://www.nbcolympics.com/athletes/ryota-yamamoto-35700)

### Pair Chemistry Assessment
| Factor | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Combined SJ** | 9/10 | Yamamoto led Olympic LH jumping; Watabe is career-elite jumper |
| **Combined XC** | 5/10 | Watabe declining at 37; Yamamoto regularly fades on XC |
| **Team Sprint experience** | 3/5 | Extensive partnership including Beijing 2022 team bronze [(Waseda)](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/athletic/news-en/2022/03/04/25439/) |
| **Balance** | Heavily SJ-skewed | Jump superbly, then try to survive the XC chase |
| **Emotional factor** | Maximum | Watabe's final race + final Olympic NC event ever |

### Pair Verdict: **5th-7th REALISTIC — Medal requires miracles**
Japan's jumping can build a 20-30 second lead. But the XC erosion from Norway, Austria, Finland, and Germany will be relentless. Watabe at 37 cannot match sprint-relay intensity against athletes 10+ years younger. The heart-warming farewell story deserves a medal, but the legs likely cannot deliver one.

## PAIR 6: ESTONIA (BIB 7) — Ruubert Teder / Kristjan Ilves

### The Pair Dynamic
The ultimate **one-man-carries-all** pairing. Ilves is an elite performer who won the Olympic SJ round and has 12 WC podiums. Teder is a 16-17 year old at his first Olympics. The gap between these two athletes is arguably the widest in the entire field.

### Athlete 1: Ruubert Teder (EST)
- **Age:** 16-17 (youngest in the field) | **FIS Code (NC):** 262510, **(SJ):** 287258 [(FIS NC)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=262510&type=result) [(FIS SJ)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=jp&competitorid=287258&type=result)
- **Olympic form:** 34th in Individual NH/10km — first Olympic appearance [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/ruubert-teder)
- **WC best:** 52nd at Otepää (home event) [(Start List)](00_race_info/start_list_raw.md)
- **Very limited international experience** — essentially a development athlete thrust onto the Olympic stage

### Athlete 2: Kristjan Ilves (EST)
- **Age:** 29 | **FIS Code:** 161576 [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=NK&competitorid=161576)

- **Injury history:** Overcame spinal injury in 2019-20 [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2019-20/kristjan-ilves-sidelined-with-spinal-injury)
- **Sponsorships:** Red Bull athlete, Swix ambassador [(Red Bull)](https://www.redbull.com/int-en/athlete/kristjan-ilves) [(Swix)](https://swixsport.com/us/article/ambassadors/kristjan-ilves)

### Pair Chemistry Assessment
| Factor | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Combined SJ** | 7/10 | Ilves won the Olympic SJ round, but Teder is inexperienced |
| **Combined XC** | 4/10 | Ilves is good (not elite) on XC; Teder's ability at this level is unknown |
| **Team Sprint experience** | 1/5 | No meaningful TS history as a pair |
| **Balance** | Extremely uneven | Ilves must carry everything; Teder is a question mark every rotation |

### Pair Verdict: **7th-9th REALISTIC — Dark horse for 5th-6th**
Ilves can produce a spectacular jumping lead, but Teder's limitations on XC will bleed time every rotation. If Teder merely survives his legs without catastrophe, Estonia could challenge for 5th-6th. If he struggles, 10th+ is possible. The generational gap (29 vs 16-17) is unprecedented in Olympic NC team sprint history.

## PAIR 7: ITALY (BIB 8) — Samuel Costa / Aaron Kostner

### The Pair Dynamic
The **hometown heroes**. Costa's WC debut was at Val di Fiemme in 2012; he has a Team Sprint podium at this exact venue (3rd, January 2017); he came out of retirement specifically for these home Olympics [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/samuel-costa-the-passion-for-the-sport-is-still-the-same-).

- **Quote:** "Fired up for the Olympics" [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2024-25/aaron-kostner-fired-up-for-the-olympics)

### Pair Chemistry Assessment
| Factor | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Combined SJ** | 6/10 | Both moderate — no elite jumper in the pair |
| **Combined XC** | 6/10 | Both solid but not elite — reliable not spectacular |
| **Team Sprint experience** | 4/5 | Costa has a **TS podium at this venue** (2017); Summer GP TS win (2025) [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/archive/athlete-profiles/article=samuel-costa) |
| **Home advantage** | Maximum | Both from South Tyrol, Predazzo is their backyard, crowd will be electric |
| **Balance** | Even but modest | Neither athlete is a superstar, but neither is a liability |

### Pair Verdict: **6th-8th REALISTIC — 5th with perfect home-crowd performance**
Italy's pair won't beat the big four on raw talent, but the home venue advantage is real. Costa knows this course intimately — he's raced Team Sprints here and podiumed. The crowd factor in team sprints can be electrifying. A best-case scenario is 5th; a medal requires a miracle.

## PAIR 8: FRANCE (BIB 9) — Mael Tyrode / Marco Heinis

### The Pair Dynamic
A **surprise selection + breakthrough talent** pairing. Heinis is having a career-defining season at age 22, while Tyrode was a last-minute addition via Netherlands quota reallocation. France is a Heinis-driven team.

- **Team affiliation:** Équipe de France [(Equipe de France)](https://www.equipedefrance.com/athlete/marco-heinis)

### Pair Chemistry Assessment
| Factor | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Combined SJ** | 6/10 | Heinis is elite (top 10 Olympic SJ); Tyrode is limited |
| **Combined XC** | 5/10 | Heinis is developing; Tyrode is unproven at this level |
| **Team Sprint experience** | 1/5 | Tyrode raced TS at Summer GP (3rd) but no WC TS together |
| **Balance** | Uneven | Heinis must carry the jumping; Tyrode's XC at Olympic level is a question mark |

### Pair Verdict: **9th-11th REALISTIC — 7th-8th ceiling**
France is a story of potential — Heinis is having a breakout campaign and could deliver a massive jump. But Tyrode's limited experience and the XC gap to the favorites make a medal impossible. A strong performance would be finishing top 8.

## PAIR 9: USA (BIB 6) — Niklas Malacinski / Benjamin Loomis

### The Pair Dynamic
America's Nordic Combined program sends its two strongest athletes — Malacinski is the younger star on the rise, Loomis is the experienced veteran at his third Olympics.

### Athlete 1: Niklas Malacinski (USA)

- **Profiles:** [(Team USA)](https://www.teamusa.com/profiles/ben-loomis) [(NC USA)](https://www.nordiccombinedusa.org/athletes/ben-loomis/)

### Pair Chemistry Assessment
| Factor | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Combined SJ** | 6/10 | Both solid — no weakness, no standout |
| **Combined XC** | 5/10 | Both competitive but not elite on the WC circuit |
| **Team Sprint experience** | 2/5 | Beijing 2022 team experience, but no TS-specific results |

### Pair Verdict: **8th-10th REALISTIC**
A solid, professional US pair that will compete respectably. Malacinski's 13th at LH/10km shows he can mix it with the mid-pack Europeans. But the gap to the medal contenders is significant. A top-8 finish would be an excellent result for the US NC program.

## PAIR 10: CZECHIA (BIB 5) — Jan Vytrval / Jiri Konvalinka

### The Pair Dynamic
A veteran/rising talent pairing from a historically competitive Czech program. Vytrval brings Olympic experience (Beijing 2022 — 7th in Team LH) and WCh pedigree (7th Team Sprint 2021).

### Athlete 1: Jan Vytrval (CZE)

### Pair Verdict: **9th-11th REALISTIC**
Czechia has a competent pair with meaningful Team Sprint championship experience (Vytrval's 7th at 2021 WCh). They won't challenge for medals but should be competitive in the mid-pack scrap for 8th-10th.

## PAIR 11: SLOVENIA (BIB 4) — Gasper Brecl / Vid Vrhovnik

### The Pair Dynamic
Two experienced Slovenians — Vrhovnik is a 3-time Olympian (22nd in LH at these Games) while Brecl is a WCh veteran (7th Mixed Team 2025). Slovenia has made strides in NC, including writing "mixed team history" at Tschagguns [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2024-25/tschagguns-slovenia-writes-mixed-team-history).

### Pair Verdict: **10th-12th REALISTIC**
A solid mid-pack Slovenian pairing with consistent 7th-place finishes in various formats. They lack the ceiling to challenge for the top 8 but should compete respectably.

## PAIR 12: CHINA (BIB 3) — Zhao Zihe / Zhao Jiawen

### The Pair Dynamic
The **Zhao twins** (or brothers — same surname, different given names) represent China's NC program that burst onto the scene at Beijing 2022. Jiawen was China's **first-ever NC Olympian** [(Xinhua)](https://english.news.cn/20220209/b730e382fe134a728710545e527d740f/c.html).

- **Age:** [mid-20s] | **FIS Code:** 231685 [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=231685&type=result)

- **WC best:** 34th Ruka [(Start List)](00_race_info/start_list_raw.md)

### Pair Verdict: **11th-13th REALISTIC**
The Zhao pairing has improved dramatically — from program pioneers at Beijing 2022 to competitive mixed-team performers. Their 8th in Mixed Team at these Games shows progress. They'll compete honorably but medal contention is beyond reach.

## PAIR 13: POLAND (BIB 2) — Kacper Jarzabek / Milosz Krzempek

### The Pair Dynamic
A young Polish pair at their first Olympic Games, representing a developing NC program backed by Poland's strong ski jumping tradition.

### Pair Verdict: **12th-14th REALISTIC**
Poland's pair is gaining experience. Both finished 33rd in individual events — competitive for a developing program but far from medal contention. The Olympic experience itself is the win for Polish NC.

---

## PAIR 14: UKRAINE (BIB 1) — Oleksandr Shumbarets / Dmytro Mazurchuk

### The Pair Dynamic
A pair representing Ukraine under extraordinarily challenging circumstances, competing despite the ongoing war. Their presence at the Olympics is itself a remarkable achievement.

### Athlete 1: Oleksandr Shumbarets (UKR)
- **FIS Code:** [via Mazurchuk profile] [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=193561&type=result)

- **Venue connection:** Career-best WC result (16th) at **Predazzo** — knows this venue [(Start List)](00_race_info/start_list_raw.md)
- **Historical context:** Ukrainian NC at the Olympics represents "historic results" for the nation [(Ukrainska Pravda)](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/12/01/7487059/) [(Mezha.net)](https://mezha.net/eng/bukvy/ukrainian-nordic-combined-athletes-compete-at-2026-winter-olympics/)
- **Beijing 2022:** Competed as a 2-time Olympian [(Olympics.com)](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/nordic-combined/athlete-profile-n1042080-dmytro-mazurchuk.htm)

### Pair Verdict: **13th-14th REALISTIC**
Ukraine's participation is a triumph of determination. Mazurchuk's 16th-place career-best came at Predazzo, giving him venue familiarity. Their 9th at the 2025 WCh Team event shows they can compete. Finishing strong and representing Ukraine with pride is the goal.

# FINAL PREDICTED ORDER

| Position | Team | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **GOLD** | **Norway** (Skoglund/Oftebro) | Oftebro's XC dominance is the defining factor. 3 golds this week. Overcame 22s deficit at LH event. |
| **SILVER** | **Austria** (Rettenegger/Lamparter) | Best combined SJ+XC balance. Lamparter has TS gold experience (2021). Youngest elite pair. |
| **BRONZE** | **Finland** (Hirvonen/Herola) | Only proven TS pair (Lahti 2019 winners). Both Olympic bronze medalists. Dual elite XC. |
| **4th** | **Germany** (Rydzek/Geiger) | Venue history (2nd in 2019 TS here). 136 combined WC podiums. But Geiger fitness is the X-factor. |
| **5th** | **Japan** (Watabe/Yamamoto) | Elite jumping from Yamamoto. Watabe's farewell emotion. But XC deficit is too large. |
| **6th** | **Italy** (Costa/Kostner) | Home venue. Costa's TS podium here (2017). Crowd factor. But raw speed gap to top 5. |
| **7th** | **Estonia** (Teder/Ilves) | Ilves can win the SJ round. But Teder at 16-17 is a massive liability every rotation. |
| **8th** | **USA** (Malacinski/Loomis) | Malacinski's 13th at LH shows competitiveness. Solid pair. |
| **9th** | **Czechia** (Vytrval/Konvalinka) | Vytrval's 7th at 2021 WCh TS shows format experience. |
| **10th** | **France** (Tyrode/Heinis) | Heinis's breakthrough jumping. But Tyrode's XC is unproven. |
| **11th** | **Slovenia** (Brecl/Vrhovnik) | Consistent mid-packers. |
| **12th** | **China** (Zhao/Zhao) | Improving program; 8th Mixed Team here. |
| **13th** | **Poland** (Jarzabek/Krzempek) | Building experience. |
| **14th** | **Ukraine** (Shumbarets/Mazurchuk) | Competing with pride under extraordinary circumstances. |
