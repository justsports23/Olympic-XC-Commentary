# Nordic Combined Team Sprint — Broadcast Analysis for Commentators
## Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics | Predazzo, THU 19 February 2026

---

## How to Use This Document

This is a team-by-team broadcast commentary guide for the **final Nordic Combined event at the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics** — and potentially the **last Nordic Combined event in Olympic history**. Each entry covers: the pairing logic, what each athlete brings, the complementary dynamic, format-specific experience, and a broadcaster-ready storyline hook. Teams are ordered by medal probability.

**Format reminder:** Two-phase event.
1. **Ski Jumping** (Predazzo Large Hill, HS 104, K-Point 95m) [(NBC Olympics)](https://nbcolympics.com/news/nordic-combined-101-venue) — each athlete takes ONE jump. Combined team scores are converted to Gundersen time gaps.
2. **Cross-Country Sprint Relay** (2x7.5km, 15km total) — teams of 2 alternate legs. Best jumping team starts first; others chase at calculated intervals. Multiple sprint legs per athlete (~3 legs of ~2.5km each).

**Critical context:** The IOC has removed Nordic Combined from the 2030 Olympic program. This event is the **farewell to 100 years of Olympic Nordic Combined** [(Race Overview)](../00_race_info/race_overview.md).

## THE OVERARCHING NARRATIVE

*"We are watching history end. Nordic Combined has been at every Winter Olympics since 1924 — one hundred years, unbroken. Today is the final chapter. Fourteen teams. Twenty-eight athletes. And when the last skier crosses the finish line, a century of Olympic tradition goes with them."*

## TIER 1: GOLD FAVORITES

---

### BIB 12 — NORWAY: Andreas Skoglund (Athlete 1) / Jens Luraas Oftebro (Athlete 2)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Norway deploys the **single most dominant athlete in the sport** alongside a breakout 24-year-old. Oftebro has already won 3 gold medals and 1 silver at these Games [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/winter-olympics-2026-jens-luras-oftebro-claims-second-gold-of-games-in-nordic-combined-individual-gundersen-large-hill-10km). Skoglund provides strong support with two 4th-place finishes — agonizingly close to medals in both individual events [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/51288). This is a "superstar + solid support" construction.

**What Skoglund Brings (Athlete 1):**
- Two 4th-place finishes at these Olympics — NH and LH individual — just off the podium both times [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/51288)
- Breakout 2025-26 season: 2 WC podiums (3rd Otepaa, 3rd Seefeld) after dominating Continental Cup (won Klingenthal with longest jump of the day at 131.5m) [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2024-25/coc-andreas-skoglund-wins-individual-compact) [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/einar-luraas-oftebro-takes-thrilling-maiden-world-cup-win-in-otepaeae)
- Junior World Championship gold in Mixed Team (Lahti 2021) [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Skoglund)
- **Caution:** DSQ at Ruka season opener for suit violation — equipment compliance has been shaky [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=189544&type=result)
- Role: Hold position. Don't lose time. Deliver Oftebro into his legs with a manageable gap.

**What Oftebro Brings (Athlete 2):**
- **3 Olympic golds at these Games**: NH individual (+1.0s over Lamparter), LH individual (+5.9s over Lamparter), Team event [(Olympics.com NH)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/winter-olympics-2026-jens-luras-oftebro-unleashes-late-sprint-to-claim-nordic-combined-individual-gundersen-normal-hill-10km-gold) [(Olympics.com LH)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/winter-olympics-2026-jens-luras-oftebro-claims-second-gold-of-games-in-nordic-combined-individual-gundersen-large-hill-10km)
- 46 WC podiums (17 wins); 2024-25 Overall WC Champion (1,451 pts) [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-the-full-list-of-2024-2025-world-cup-winners-0322/)
- "Never spectacular in jumping, but formidable in cross-country skiing" [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42330)
- **The signature stat:** Overcame a **22-second jumping deficit** to win LH gold by 5.9 seconds [(NBC Olympics)](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/norways-jens-luraas-oftebro-goes-2-2-after-climbing-nordic-combined-large-hill-gold)
- His NH gold ended Norway's **28-year drought** in that event [(NBC Olympics)](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/jens-luraas-oftebro-claims-norways-first-victory-nordic-combined-normal-hill-28-years)
- Role: The weapon. Close every gap. Attack every leg. Win the race.

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
Norway's strategy is transparent: survive the jumping, then unleash Oftebro. The risk is Skoglund. When Oftebro is resting during tag exchanges, Skoglund must race head-to-head against Rettenegger (16 WC podiums) and Geiger (67 WC podiums). Skoglund has 2 WC podiums. The math is worrying on paper — but Skoglund's two Olympic 4ths show he rises to championship moments.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Jens Luraas Oftebro has won every Nordic Combined event he's entered at these Olympics. Three golds. One silver. He overcame a 22-second deficit in the Large Hill individual and still won by nearly six seconds. Today, he has help — Andreas Skoglund, who finished 4th in BOTH individual events. If Norway can stay within 15 seconds after jumping, Oftebro will do the rest. He always does."*

**Key Stat for Graphics:**
| Oftebro at Milano Cortina 2026 | Result |
|------|--------|
| Individual NH/10km | **GOLD** (beat Lamparter by 1.0s) |
| Individual LH/10km | **GOLD** (beat Lamparter by 5.9s) |
| Team Event | **GOLD** |
| Mixed Team | Silver |
| Team Sprint | ? |

### BIB 14 — AUSTRIA: Stefan Rettenegger (Athlete 1) / Johannes Lamparter (Athlete 2)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Austria fields the **most balanced pair** in the competition. Both athletes are legitimate top-10 individual performers. Both can jump. Both can ski. Where Norway has a superstar and a supporter, Austria has two elite weapons. This is the "build a lead and defend it" team.

**What Rettenegger Brings (Athlete 1):**
- Won Seefeld compact jump — among "the best jumpers in the field" [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-seefeld-triple-stefan-rettenegger-after-the-compact-jump-the-best-cross-country-skiers-well-placed-0131/)
- Dominated Ruka XC mass start — he can ski, not just jump [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-ruka-stefan-rettenegger-dominates-the-cross-country-mass-start-edgar-vallet-best-frenchman-1130/)
- 4th at Olympic NH event (+17s) — so close to a medal [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/19975)
- **The defining storyline:** 16 WC podiums — **ZERO wins.** 9 runner-up finishes. He's the most prominent athlete in NC who has never won a World Cup [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=196343&type=result)
- After losing to Oftebro at Seefeld despite a 9.8-point jumping lead: "Tut verdammt weh" — "It hurts like hell" [(SportNews.bz)](https://en.sportnews.bz/artikel/wintersport/nordische-kombination/lebenstraum-von-kombinierer-platzt-tut-verdammt-weh)
- At 23, the youngest among the elite contenders [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=196343&type=result)
- Equipment: Atomic skis [(Atomic)](https://www.atomic.com/en/athletes/stefan-rettenegger)
- Role: Build the jumping lead. Hold position on XC legs. Don't let Skoglund overtake him.

**What Lamparter Brings (Athlete 2):**
- **Double Olympic silver medalist** at these Games — 2nd NH (+1.0s behind Oftebro), 2nd LH (+5.9s behind Oftebro) [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/19966) [(Yahoo Sports)](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/oftebro-beats-lamparter-again-olympic-142828511.html)
- **Leading the 2025-26 WC overall** with 5+ wins this season [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/lamparter-dominates-otepaeae-compact-to-extend-overall-lead)
- **2021 World Championship Team Sprint GOLD** — proven in this exact format [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=209403&type=result)
- 62 WC podiums (22 wins); 2022-23 Crystal Globe — first Austrian since Gottwald in 2000-01 [(JumpandReach)](https://www.jumpandreach.com/overall-world-cup-victory-for-johannes-lamparter/?lang=en)
- Equipment: Fischer skis, Leki poles; Red Bull sponsored [(Red Bull)](https://www.redbull.com/int-en/athlete/johannes-lamparter)
- Role: Match Oftebro stride for stride. If the gap is under 10 seconds going into the final leg, Lamparter has the speed to compete for gold.

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
Austria's architecture is "Build and Defend." Rettenegger's elite jumping creates the lead; Lamparter's elite XC defends it. The vulnerability is that Rettenegger has never proven he can hold a lead under pressure — his career is defined by being overtaken. But in Team Sprint, he only needs to hold against Skoglund (not Oftebro). And Lamparter has won a WC Team Sprint gold before — he knows this format intimately.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Johannes Lamparter has finished second to Oftebro TWICE at these Olympics. One second. Then six seconds. Two silvers. Today he has reinforcements — Stefan Rettenegger, one of the best jumpers in the field, who can build the lead that Lamparter needs to finally beat the Norwegian. But here's the stat that keeps Austrian coaches awake at night: Rettenegger has 16 World Cup podiums and ZERO wins. He has never closed out a lead under pressure. Can he do it when Olympic gold is on the line?"*

### BIB 13 — GERMANY: Johannes Rydzek (Athlete 1) / Vinzenz Geiger (Athlete 2)

**The Pairing Logic:**
The **most decorated pair in the history of the sport.** A combined 136 WC podiums, 48 WC wins, 6 Olympic medals, 22 World Championship medals. Both from SC 1906 Oberstdorf — the same club, the same town, training partners for over a decade [(Ski Club Oberstdorf)](https://www.skiclub-oberstdorf.de/club/athleten/vinzenz-geiger.html). AND they finished **2nd in the 2019 WC Team Sprint at this exact venue** [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1074178/geiger-claims-maiden-nordic-combined-world-cup-win-in-val-di-fiemme).

**What Rydzek Brings (Athlete 1):**
- **14 World Championship medals** (7 gold, 6 silver, 1 bronze) — including the UNPRECEDENTED 2017 Lahti grand slam: four golds in four events (Individual NH, Individual LH, Team NH, **Team Sprint**) [(Axelent)](https://www.axelent.de/x-news-old/2017/historical-performance-at-the-world-championships-in-lahti-by-johannes-rydzek/)
- **Holmenkollen Medal** recipient — Nordic skiing's highest honor [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2021-22/holmenkollen-medal-for-johannes-rydzek)
- 5-time Olympian (Vancouver, Sochi, PyeongChang, Beijing, Milano Cortina) — 4 Olympic medals (2G, 1S, 1B) [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/johannes-rydzek)
- 69 WC podiums (26 wins) [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=105277&type=result)
- Won the 2019 WC Individual at **this venue** (26:58.4) [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1074178/geiger-claims-maiden-nordic-combined-world-cup-win-in-val-di-fiemme)
- Ended a **6-year, 2,150-day WC win drought** at Ruka November 2024 — emotional comeback [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2024-25/rydzek-ends-six-year-wait-for-wins-with-dream-return-in-ruka)
- **Age concern:** 34 years old — oldest among the medal contenders alongside Watabe
- Role: The tactical brain. Jump well, manage XC legs intelligently, use a decade of championship experience to read the race.

**What Geiger Brings (Athlete 2):**
- **Reigning WC Overall Champion** — 2024-25 Crystal Globe (1,506 pts, 7 wins, 13/17 podiums) [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2024-25/armbruster-and-geiger-are-overall-world-cup-champions)
- Beijing 2022 **Olympic gold** — one of the most dramatic rallies in NC history: started 11th after jumping (1:26 deficit), won the 10km XC in 25:07.7 [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/vinzenz-geiger-wins-individual-gundersen-normal-hill-10km-gold)
- 67 WC podiums (22 wins) [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=157487&type=result)
- **His FIRST EVER WC win came at this venue** — Val di Fiemme, January 2019 (26:34.0, fastest XC of the day) [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1074178/geiger-claims-maiden-nordic-combined-world-cup-win-in-val-di-fiemme) [(Ski Club Oberstdorf)](https://www.skiclub-oberstdorf.de/club/athleten/vinzenz-geiger.html)
- **CRITICAL FITNESS QUESTION:** Tore foot ligaments in autumn 2025 — missed Ruka and Trondheim WC events [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-vinzenz-geiger-last-winters-globe-winner-will-not-take-part-in-the-ruka-and-trondheim-world-cups-due-to-a-foot-injury-1110). Won Seefeld Compact Triple on return [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-triple-in-seefeld-vinzenz-geiger-wins-after-a-sublime-sprint-on-the-compact-course-0131). But **felt unwell in final 1.8km** of Olympic NH event — finished 10th [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/nordic-combined-vinzenz-geiger-the-zen-warrior)
- Equipment: Atomic skis [(Atomic)](https://www.atomic.com/en/athletes/vinzenz-geiger)
- Role: The engine — IF he's fit. Geiger's XC ability is among the top 3 in the sport. But repeated sprint legs will test his damaged foot.

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
Rydzek and Geiger are the ONLY pair in this field who have raced a Team Sprint **at this venue together** — they finished 2nd (+0.5s) behind Norway in the 2019 WC Team Sprint at Val di Fiemme [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1074178/geiger-claims-maiden-nordic-combined-world-cup-win-in-val-di-fiemme). They know the tag exchange zone. They know the XC course. They know each other's pacing. That venue-specific experience is unique in this field.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Let me tell you about this German pair. Between them: 136 World Cup podiums. 48 wins. 22 World Championship medals. Six Olympic medals. Johannes Rydzek won all four golds at the 2017 World Championships — nobody has done that before or since. Vinzenz Geiger won his first ever World Cup right here in Val di Fiemme in 2019. AND they finished second in the Team Sprint at this venue that same weekend. They have done this, at this place, together. The only question today is Geiger's fitness — he tore foot ligaments in the autumn and felt unwell at the NH event. If his body holds, this is the most dangerous team in the field."*

**Key Stat for Graphics:**
| Germany Combined Resume | Rydzek | Geiger | Total |
|------------------------|--------|--------|-------|
| WC Podiums | 69 | 67 | **136** |
| WC Wins | 26 | 22 | **48** |
| Olympic Medals | 4 | 3 | **7** |
| WCh Medals | 14 | 8 | **22** |
| Venue Wins (Val di Fiemme) | 1 (2019) | 1 (2019) | **2** |

### BIB 11 — FINLAND: Eero Hirvonen (Athlete 1) / Ilkka Herola (Athlete 2)

**The Pairing Logic:**
The **only pair in the field who have won a World Cup Team Sprint together** — Lahti 2019, by 0.2 seconds over Norway [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1075343/finnish-pairing-celebrates-team-sprint-success-at-fis-nordic-combined-world-cup-in-lahti) [(Fischer Sports)](https://www.fischersports.com/us_en/news/herolahirvonen-celebrate-home-victory-in-lahti). AND both won Olympic bronze medals at these Games within six days of each other. This is a pair peaking together at the perfect moment.

**What Hirvonen Brings (Athlete 1):**
- **Olympic bronze medalist** — Individual NH/10km at these Games, ending Finland's **20-year Nordic Combined medal drought** [(Finland Today)](https://finlandtoday.fi/eero-hirvonen-wins-finlands-first-medal-of-milan-cortina-olympics-with-bronze-in-nordic-combined/) [(Helsinki Times)](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/themes/themes/sports/28506-eero-hirvonen-takes-olympic-bronze-in-nordic-combined) [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-eero-hirvonen-the-bronze-that-wakes-up-finlands-nordic-combined-team-0211/)
- 11 WC podiums (1 win, 3 seconds, 7 thirds) [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=181024&type=result)
- Elite XC skier — rose from **31st to 9th** at Trondheim on cross-country ability alone [(Start List)](../00_race_info/start_list_raw.md)
- Finnish National Champion [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2023-24/finnish-national-titles-for-korhonen-and-hirvonen)
- Role: Elite XC legs. Limit jumping deficit. Race with the confidence of a man who just won an Olympic medal.

**What Herola Brings (Athlete 2):**
- **Olympic bronze medalist** — Individual LH/10km at these Games (+14.8s) [(Daily Finland)](https://www.dailyfinland.fi/sports/47881/Herola-wins-4th-medal-for-Finland-at-Milan-Cortina-Olympics) [(Helsinki Times)](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/themes/themes/sports/28532-ilkka-herola-claims-olympic-bronze-niskanen-left-out-of-sprint.html)
- **Maiden WC win:** Oslo/Holmenkollen March 2025 — set a **hill record of 146.0m**, then won by **34 seconds**. First Finnish individual WC win in **15 years** [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2024-25/herola-storms-to-maiden-win-as-riiber-bows-out-and-geiger-moves-to-brink-of-crystal-globe)
- 21 WC podiums (2 wins, 7 seconds, 12 thirds); WCh Silver (Individual NH 2021 Oberstdorf) [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=NK&competitorid=171139)
- 4-time Olympian — 12 years on the World Cup circuit [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/45070)
- Quote: "It's been a long time without the medal and, of course, after all these years, it feels great to finally achieve it" [(Helsinki Times)](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/themes/themes/sports/28532-ilkka-herola-claims-olympic-bronze-niskanen-left-out-of-sprint.html)
- Role: Strong jumping (hill record holder at Holmenkollen). Elite XC. The proven Team Sprint finisher.

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
This pair's edge is not raw individual talent — neither matches Oftebro or Lamparter on paper. Their edge is **proven Team Sprint chemistry**. In relay formats, communication, tag timing, and pacing trust matter enormously. Hirvonen and Herola have done this together, at the highest level, and won by 0.2 seconds [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1075343/finnish-pairing-celebrates-team-sprint-success-at-fis-nordic-combined-world-cup-in-lahti). BOTH are elite XC skiers — there is no weak link on the cross-country course. At age 30, both are in the physiological sweet spot for repeated high-intensity sprint efforts.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Here's a stat that matters more than any other in this race: Finland's Hirvonen and Herola are the ONLY pair in this field who have won a Team Sprint together. Lahti 2019. Beat Norway by two-tenths of a second. Today they come in as double Olympic bronze medalists — Hirvonen in the Normal Hill, Herola in the Large Hill — both medals won this week. Twenty years Finland waited for a Nordic Combined medal. Now they have two. Can they make it three? These two know how to race together. They've done it before."*

## TIER 2: MEDAL OUTSIDERS

---

### BIB 10 — JAPAN: Akito Watabe (Athlete 1) / Ryota Yamamoto (Athlete 2)

**The Pairing Logic:**
A **legend's farewell.** Watabe is a 6-time Olympian — the most experienced athlete at these Games — in his final competitive season. Yamamoto **led the Olympic LH jumping phase** at these Games [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/olympic-games-2026-nordic-combined-marco-heinis-in-the-top-10-after-jumping-the-gundersen-large-hill-ryota-yamamoto-in-the-lead-0217/). Japan's strategy: build an enormous jumping lead, then survive the XC chase.

**What Watabe Brings (Athlete 1):**
- **6-time Olympian** — Torino 2006 through Milano Cortina 2026. **79 WC podiums** (19 wins, 31 seconds, 29 thirds). 2017-18 Crystal Globe. 4 Olympic medals (2S, 2B). 10 WCh participations (1G, 1S, 4B) [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akito_Watabe) [(Japan Times)](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2020/03/02/more-sports/winter-sports-more-sports/akito-watabe-notches-18th-career-world-cup-title/)
- **300th World Cup start** at Seefeld [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-triple-in-seefeld-a-special-number-for-akito-watabes-300th-world-cup-start-0130/)
- Announced retirement at season's end [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-japanese-legend-akito-watabe-to-retire-at-the-end-of-the-season-1023/) [(NBC Olympics)](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/akito-watabe-savors-sixth-and-final-olympics-japanese-veteran-prepares-bow-out)
- Japanese flag-bearer at Beijing 2022 opening ceremony [(Waseda)](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/athletic/news-en/2022/02/08/24697/)
- Olympic form: 11th (NH), 19th (LH) — declining but still competitive [(NBC Olympics)](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/akito-watabe-savors-sixth-and-final-olympics-japanese-veteran-prepares-bow-out)
- Role: Use 20 years of championship experience. Manage effort. Don't let the emotion overwhelm the tactics.

**What Yamamoto Brings (Athlete 2):**
- **Led the Olympic LH jumping phase** — the best jumper at this Games' marquee event [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/olympic-games-2026-nordic-combined-marco-heinis-in-the-top-10-after-jumping-the-gundersen-large-hill-ryota-yamamoto-in-the-lead-0217/)
- Won Ramsau SJ round [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-ramsau-ryota-yamamoto-wins-the-individual-compact-jumping-competition-marco-heinis-best-frenchman-1221/)
- 7 WC podiums (1 second, 6 thirds); Beijing 2022 Team bronze [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/ryota-yamamoto) [(Waseda)](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/athletic/news-en/2022/03/04/25439/)
- **Key weakness:** Regularly loses significant positions during XC — elite jumping, moderate cross-country [(NBC Olympics)](https://www.nbcolympics.com/athletes/ryota-yamamoto-35700)
- Role: Deliver the biggest possible jumping lead for both athletes combined.

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
Japan is the ultimate "Jump and Pray" team. Yamamoto can realistically produce the strongest individual jump in the field — he led the Olympic LH jumping. Watabe, even at 37, is a solid jumper. If Japan's combined jumping score builds a 25-30 second lead, they force the XC favorites to chase at maximum intensity from the start. But Watabe at 37 cannot match sprint-relay intensity against athletes 10-13 years younger, and Yamamoto's XC regularly bleeds time. Every rotation, their lead erodes.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Akito Watabe. Six Olympics. Seventy-nine World Cup podiums. Three hundred starts. The Japanese flag at Beijing's opening ceremony. Today is his final competitive race. And it may be the final Nordic Combined race at the Olympics — ever. Watabe has said: 'I want to finish with a smile.' He's paired with Ryota Yamamoto, who led the jumping at the Large Hill event three days ago. If Yamamoto can jump Japan into the lead, this becomes a farewell fight — Watabe using every ounce of his twenty years of experience to hold off the young guns. The stadium will be on its feet."*

---

### BIB 7 — ESTONIA: Ruubert Teder (Athlete 1) / Kristjan Ilves (Athlete 2)

**The Pairing Logic:**
The most **extreme contrast** of any pair: Ilves is an elite performer with 12 WC podiums who **won the Olympic ski jumping round** at the NH event [(ERR News)](https://news.err.ee/1609939043/kristjan-ilves-6th-in-winter-olympics-nordic-combined-after-early-lead). Teder is **16-17 years old** — the youngest athlete in the entire field, at his first Olympics, with a WC best of 52nd [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=262510&type=result). The generational gap is unprecedented.

**What Ilves Brings (Athlete 2):**
- **Won the SJ round** at Olympic NH event (132.6 pts, 99m); finished **6th** — career-best Olympic result [(ERR News)](https://news.err.ee/1609939043/kristjan-ilves-6th-in-winter-olympics-nordic-combined-after-early-lead)
- 12 WC podiums (6 seconds, 6 thirds); 4-time Olympian; WCh 4th (Individual LH 2023) [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristjan_Ilves)
- **Trains with Team Norway** since 2019 — has access to elite Norwegian coaching [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2019-20/kristjan-ilves-joins-forces-with-team-norway)
- Overcame a spinal injury in 2019-20 [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2019-20/kristjan-ilves-sidelined-with-spinal-injury)
- Red Bull and Swix sponsored [(Red Bull)](https://www.redbull.com/int-en/athlete/kristjan-ilves) [(Swix)](https://swixsport.com/us/article/ambassadors/kristjan-ilves)

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Kristjan Ilves won the ski jumping round at the Normal Hill event. He led the Olympics. He finished 6th — his best ever. Today he's paired with Ruubert Teder, who is sixteen years old. Sixteen. The youngest athlete in any sport at these Games. Ilves trains with Team Norway, competes for tiny Estonia, and today carries an entire nation on his shoulders alongside a teenager. If Teder can simply survive his XC legs without losing too much time, Ilves's jumping might do the rest."*

### BIB 8 — ITALY: Samuel Costa (Athlete 1) / Aaron Kostner (Athlete 2)

**The Pairing Logic:**
**Hometown heroes.** Costa's WC debut was at Val di Fiemme in 2012. He has a **Team Sprint podium at this exact venue** (3rd, January 2017) [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/archive/athlete-profiles/article=samuel-costa). He came out of retirement specifically for these home Olympics — "The passion for the sport is still the same" [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/samuel-costa-the-passion-for-the-sport-is-still-the-same-). Kostner is from **Moena, 20km from Predazzo** [(SportNews.bz)](https://en.sportnews.bz/artikel/wintersport/nordische-kombination/kurz-vor-olympia-suedtirols-kombinierer-werden-immer-besser).

**What Costa Brings (Athlete 1):**
- 3-time Olympian; 7 WCh participations (2 x 4th); 4 WC podiums (all 3rds) [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=NK&competitorid=124114)

- **Team Sprint 3rd at Predazzo 2017** — podium at this exact venue in this exact format [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/archive/athlete-profiles/article=samuel-costa)
- Won **Summer GP Team Sprint at Chaux-Neuve** (August 2025) — format preparation [(Nordic Mag)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-edgar-vallet-and-mael-tyrode-on-home-soil-finish-third-in-the-team-sprint-at-the-summer-grand-prix-in-chaux-neuve-0831/)
- From Bolzano, South Tyrol [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Costa_(skier))

- From **Moena** — 20km from Predazzo, racing on his home course [(SportNews.bz)](https://en.sportnews.bz/artikel/wintersport/nordische-kombination/kurz-vor-olympia-suedtirols-kombinierer-werden-immer-besser)
- "Fired up for the Olympics" [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2024-25/aaron-kostner-fired-up-for-the-olympics)
- WC best: 5th (Trondheim) [(Start List)](../00_race_info/start_list_raw.md)

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Listen to the crowd when Italy comes through the stadium. Samuel Costa made his World Cup debut here in 2012. He podiumed in the Team Sprint here in 2017. He retired. He came back — just for this. 'The passion is still the same,' he said. His partner Aaron Kostner is from Moena, twenty kilometers down the road. These are Dolomite boys on Dolomite snow. They won't medal today — but the noise you're hearing from fifteen thousand Italian fans might just carry them to their best result of the Games."*

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Marco Heinis — remember that name. He's 22, he finished in the top 10 of the Olympic Large Hill jumping, and he's having the season of his life. His partner Mael Tyrode only got here because the Netherlands gave up their quota spot. Nothing to lose. Everything to prove."*

## HEAD-TO-HEAD MATCHUP MAP

**The Gold Fight: Norway vs Austria**
- Oftebro has beaten Lamparter in both Olympic individual events: +1.0s (NH), +5.9s (LH) [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/winter-olympics-2026-jens-luras-oftebro-claims-second-gold-of-games-in-nordic-combined-individual-gundersen-large-hill-10km). But Lamparter leads the WC overall by 43+ points [(FIS)](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/lamparter-dominates-otepaeae-compact-to-extend-overall-lead). This is a genuine 50/50 rivalry.
- The deciding factor is the "support cast" battle: Skoglund (2 WC podiums) vs Rettenegger (16 WC podiums, 0 wins). Rettenegger is more established but historically can't close [(SportNews.bz)](https://en.sportnews.bz/artikel/wintersport/nordische-kombination/lebenstraum-von-kombinierer-platzt-tut-verdammt-weh).

**The Bronze Fight: Germany vs Finland**
- Combined WC podiums: GER 136 vs FIN 32 — massive experience gap.
- BUT: Finland has a **proven TS victory together** (Lahti 2019) [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1075343/finnish-pairing-celebrates-team-sprint-success-at-fis-nordic-combined-world-cup-in-lahti). Germany has a TS 2nd at this venue (2019) [(Inside the Games)](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1074178/geiger-claims-maiden-nordic-combined-world-cup-win-in-val-di-fiemme). Both have format pedigree.
- The swing factor: Geiger's fitness. Fit Geiger = Germany wins bronze. Fading Geiger = Finland takes it.

**The 5th Place Fight: Japan vs Estonia vs Italy**
- Japan's jumping vs Estonia's Ilves vs Italy's home crowd. Three entirely different strategies — SJ dominance, one-man carry, crowd energy.

---

## KEY MOMENTS TO WATCH

### 1. The Ski Jumping Phase (10:00 CET)
- **Watch for:** Austria's combined score. If Rettenegger AND Lamparter both jump well, Austria could start XC with a 15-20 second lead over Norway. That's the game-changer.
- **Watch for:** Yamamoto (JPN) and Ilves (EST) — both can produce the best individual jumps in the field. If either delivers a monster jump, their teams start with unexpected leads.
- **Watch for:** Geiger's (GER) jump. A good jump calms fitness concerns. A poor jump adds pressure to the XC phase.
- **Wind factor:** Predazzo's valley location channels wind unpredictably — conditions can vary between jumpers [(Tactical Notes)](tactical_notes.md). Teams jumping later (BIB 13 GER, BIB 14 AUT) as top seeds face this risk.

### 2. First XC Tag Exchange
- **Watch for:** How close the pack is. If 4+ teams are within 10 seconds, this becomes a tactical pack race. If Austria/Germany have 20+ seconds, it's a chase.
- **Watch for:** Skoglund's (NOR) first leg. If he stays in contact with the leaders, Norway's strategy is working. If he loses time, pressure mounts.

### 3. The Middle Legs (Legs 3-4)
- **Watch for:** Fatigue in older athletes. Watabe (37), Rydzek (34), Costa (33) will start showing fatigue here. Younger legs — Rettenegger (23), Lamparter (24), Skoglund (24) — should recover faster.
- **Watch for:** Geiger's body language. His Olympic NH fade happened in the final 1.8km [(Olympics.com)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/nordic-combined-vinzenz-geiger-the-zen-warrior). If he shows strain in Leg 3 or 4, Germany's medal hopes dim.

### 4. The Final Leg
- **Watch for:** Oftebro vs Lamparter — if they're racing the final leg head-to-head, history says Oftebro wins. He's beaten Lamparter in every direct Olympic duel.
- **Watch for:** The Herola factor — if Finland is close, Herola (or Hirvonen) has the sprint speed to seize a medal on the final lap.
- **The last-ever finish line:** The final athlete to cross the finish line closes a century of Olympic Nordic Combined. Make sure the cameras capture that moment.

## OPENING SCRIPT SUGGESTION

*"Good morning from Predazzo, in Italy's Val di Fiemme — the Dolomites. Today we witness the end of an era. Nordic Combined has been at every Winter Olympics since Chamonix in 1924. One hundred years. Today, fourteen teams from fourteen nations will compete in the final chapter — a Team Sprint that brings together twenty-eight athletes for one last race.*

*"The favorites: Norway, led by Jens Luraas Oftebro — already a triple gold medalist this week, possibly the greatest Nordic Combined athlete we've ever seen. Austria, with Johannes Lamparter — double silver medalist, twice beaten by Oftebro, desperate for gold. Germany, the most decorated pairing in the sport's history — Johannes Rydzek and Vinzenz Geiger, who finished second in a Team Sprint at this very venue seven years ago. And Finland — the only pair who have actually won a Team Sprint together, riding the wave of two Olympic bronze medals this week.*

*"And then there's Akito Watabe, Japan's six-time Olympian, making his 300th-and-final World Cup start. Samuel Costa, who came out of retirement to race on his home course. Kristjan Ilves, paired with a sixteen-year-old teammate. Twenty-eight athletes. One hundred years of history. One final race.*

*"Let's begin."*

---

## CLOSING SCRIPT SUGGESTION

*"And so it ends. [Winner] crosses the line and writes the final sentence in one hundred years of Olympic Nordic Combined history. From Chamonix 1924 to Predazzo 2026 — this sport, this impossible combination of flying and skiing, takes its final Olympic bow. Whatever happens next — whatever the IOC decides — today's champions will always be the last. And what a way to close the book."*
