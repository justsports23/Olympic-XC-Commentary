# Dark Horses — Nordic Combined Team Sprint LH/2x7.5km
## Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics | Predazzo, 19 February 2026

---

## 1. ESTONIA (BIB 7) — Ruubert Teder / Kristjan Ilves

**Why they could surprise:**
- Kristjan Ilves **won the ski jumping portion at the 2026 Olympics** NH event (132.6 pts, 99m) — one of the strongest jumpers in the field; 12 WC podiums overall
- Ilves finished **6th in the Olympic NH individual** — career-best Olympic result — and has been trending upward all season (6th at home WC in Otepää, 9th at Seefeld)
- Ilves trains with **Team Norway** since 2019 — has access to elite coaching and tactical preparation
- If Ilves produces a massive jump, Estonia could start the XC sprint with an unexpected lead or small gap to the favorites

**Key risk:**
- Teder is just **16-17 years old** — the youngest athlete in the entire field; extremely limited WC experience
- Ilves notably faded on the final-lap climb in the Olympic individual — his XC ceiling is "good" not "elite"
- Effectively a one-man team: Ilves must carry the jumping phase AND most of the XC load; Teder is a wildcard who could either exceed expectations or struggle at the Olympic level
- Realistic ceiling: 6th-8th; medal would require a perfect jumping round from Ilves, Teder holding his own, and multiple favorites collapsing

## 2. ITALY (BIB 8) — Samuel Costa / Aaron Kostner

**Why they could surprise:**
- **HOME VENUE advantage** — Costa's WC debut was at Val di Fiemme in 2012; he has a Team Sprint **podium at this exact venue** (3rd, January 2017); born in Bolzano, competing in his home Olympic Games
- Kostner is from **Moena (South Tyrol)**, just 20km from Predazzo — also racing at home
- Costa came out of retirement specifically for these home Olympics — "The passion for the sport is still the same"; form has been building (11th, 12th at Ramsau in late January — best results in 3 years)
- Costa won the **Summer Grand Prix Team Sprint** at Chaux-Neuve (August 2025) — format-specific preparation
- Crowd support at Predazzo will be enormous for Italy — adrenaline factor is real in team sprints
- Costa's 14th in the Olympic LH individual shows he's competitive at this level

**Key risk:**
- Costa is 33 and came out of retirement — physical decline compared to his peak
- Kostner has limited high-level results — more of a journeyman than an elite contender
- Italy's aggregate XC speed likely can't match Norway, Austria, Germany, or Finland
- Realistic ceiling: 6th-8th; a medal would require a good jumping round + other favorites' struggles + crowd-fueled overperformance

## 3. FRANCE (BIB 9) — Mael Tyrode / Marco Heinis

**Why they could surprise:**
- Heinis is having a **career breakthrough season**: 9th at Ruka (career-best WC result), top 10 in Olympic LH jumping, 14th in Olympic LH individual — he is peaking at the right moment
- Heinis is an **elite jumper** who could give France a significant time advantage going into the XC phase (138m at Oberstdorf Summer GP, consistently top 10 in SJ rounds)
- At 22, Heinis has the fearlessness and energy of a young athlete at his first Olympics
- Tyrode's surprise Olympic selection (via Netherlands quota reallocation) adds an "nothing to lose" factor — no pressure, all opportunity

**Key risk:**
- Tyrode has **very limited international experience** and was a surprise selection — his XC ability at the Olympic level is unproven
- France's combined XC depth is well below the medal favorites
- This is essentially a Heinis-carries-the-jumping, Tyrode-tries-to-hold-on pairing
- Realistic ceiling: 8th-10th; would need an extraordinary jumping performance from Heinis AND the top teams to underperform

## Dark Horse Summary

| Team | Surprise Factor | Best Case | Likely Finish |
|------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| **EST** (Teder/Ilves) | Ilves can win the jumping phase outright | 5th-6th | 7th-9th |
| **ITA** (Costa/Kostner) | Home venue + retirement comeback + crowd | 5th-6th | 7th-9th |
| **FRA** (Tyrode/Heinis) | Heinis is a breakthrough jumper peaking now | 7th-8th | 9th-11th |

**The dark horse most likely to upset the medal order is Finland** — listed in podium contenders but genuinely the team that could shock everyone for gold given their proven Team Sprint partnership (Lahti 2019) and dual Olympic bronze momentum.
