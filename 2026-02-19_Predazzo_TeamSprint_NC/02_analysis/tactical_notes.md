# Tactical Notes — Nordic Combined Team Sprint LH/2x7.5km
## Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics | Predazzo, 19 February 2026

---

## Format Breakdown

### Ski Jumping Phase
- **Hill:** Predazzo Large Hill (HS 104, K-Point 95m)
- Each athlete from the pair takes ONE jump
- Team scores are combined and converted to Gundersen time gaps
- The leading team starts the XC sprint first; others follow at calculated intervals

### Cross-Country Sprint Phase
- **Total distance:** 2x7.5km (15km per team)
- **Format:** Sprint relay — teams of 2 alternate legs (likely 3x2.5km per athlete, or similar split)
- The Gundersen start means the team with the best combined jumping score departs first
- Tag exchanges between teammates at the stadium after each leg

## Tactical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Austria/Germany Lead After Jumping
**Probability: High (40%)**
- Rettenegger (AUT) and Yamamoto (JPN) are among the best jumpers; Lamparter, Rydzek, and Geiger are all strong
- If Austria builds a 15-20 second lead over Norway, the XC becomes a chase
- **Tactical implication:** Norway (Oftebro) will need to close gaps on his legs; Skoglund must not lose time on Rettenegger/Lamparter
- Austria's strategy: Rettenegger takes early legs to build lead; Lamparter anchors and matches Oftebro stride-for-stride
- Germany's strategy: Use experience and tactical savvy to sit behind Austria and pick off teams one by one

### Scenario 2: Norway Close After Jumping (within 10 seconds)
**Probability: Moderate (30%)**
- If Skoglund jumps well and the gap is small, Norway becomes the overwhelming favorite
- **Tactical implication:** Oftebro will be unleashed on his legs — no team can match him in XC sprint mode
- Other teams must avoid being caught by Norway's "Oftebro express" — being reeled in and passed demoralizes
- Finland would benefit most from this scenario — they can draft behind Norway's chase and save energy

### Scenario 3: Jumping Spread is Large (30+ seconds between 1st and 4th)
**Probability: Moderate (25%)**
- If jumping conditions vary (wind gusts at Predazzo are common) or one team's jumper makes a mistake, the XC becomes fragmented
- **Tactical implication:** Teams race in isolation rather than packs; pure XC fitness matters more than tactics
- Favors teams with strong XC in both athletes: Norway, Finland, Austria
- Punishes teams relying on one strong athlete: Estonia (Teder liability), France (Tyrode unknown)

### Scenario 4: Mass Pack Formation in XC
**Probability: Low (5%)**
- If jumping results are very tight, multiple teams start within 5-10 seconds and form a pack on the course
- **Tactical implication:** Becomes a tactical sprint race — drafting, positioning, and closing speed matter enormously
- Favors experienced championship racers: Rydzek (2017 WC grand slam), Oftebro (3 Olympic golds this week), Lamparter (2021 WC Team Sprint gold)
- Stadium finish sprint becomes decisive — Oftebro and Lamparter have both shown sprint finishing ability

## Team-by-Team Tactical Roles

### Gold Contenders
| Team | Athlete 1 Role | Athlete 2 Role | Strategy |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **NOR** | Skoglund: Hold position, don't lose time | Oftebro: Close gaps, attack on every leg | Chase and catch |
| **AUT** | Rettenegger: Build jumping lead, solid XC | Lamparter: Defend lead, match Oftebro | Build and defend |
| **GER** | Rydzek: Jump well, tactical XC | Geiger: XC power legs, overcome any deficit | Experience and depth |
| **FIN** | Hirvonen: Elite XC, limit jumping deficit | Herola: Strong jumping + XC close | Draft and surge |

### Mid-Pack Strategy
| Team | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| **JPN** | Yamamoto delivers massive jumping lead; Watabe defends on XC for as long as possible |
| **EST** | Ilves jumps for the lead; Teder must simply survive his legs without losing too much |
| **ITA** | Costa uses home-venue knowledge; crowd energy; limit damage in jumping; solid XC from both |

## Key Tactical Factors

### 1. Jumping Conditions at Predazzo
- Predazzo's HS 104 hill is at elevation ~1,000m in the Fiemme Valley
- Wind can be unpredictable — gusts through the valley can create unequal conditions across the jumping competition
- Teams jumping later may face different conditions — gate/wind compensation becomes critical
- If conditions deteriorate, the order of jumping matters — BIB 14 (Austria) and BIB 13 (Germany) jump last as top seeds

### 2. XC Course Demands
- Predazzo/Tesero XC course details are limited, but Fiemme Valley courses typically feature:
  - Moderate elevation changes (not extreme alpine-style climbs)
  - Technical descents requiring good handling
  - A stadium section for tag exchanges
- Sprint format favors: explosive XC ability, fast transitions, and the ability to recover between legs
- Teams with good XC in BOTH athletes have a structural advantage — one weak link costs time every rotation

### 3. Fatigue Management in Sprint Relay
- Each athlete races approximately 7.5km total, split across multiple legs (likely 3 legs of ~2.5km each)
- Recovery between legs is critical — the tag exchange zone gives ~5-8 minutes of rest
- Advantage to younger athletes with better recovery: Skoglund (24), Rettenegger (23), Heinis (22)
- Disadvantage to: Watabe (37), Rydzek (34), Costa (33) — may fade in later legs
- Herola and Hirvonen (both 30) are in the "sweet spot" — experienced enough to manage effort, young enough to recover

### 4. Tag Exchange Efficiency
- Clean, fast tag exchanges can save 1-2 seconds per rotation
- Teams who train together regularly have an advantage — Norway's national team, Austria's squad, Germany's Oberstdorf duo
- Newer pairings (France: Tyrode/Heinis, China: Zhao/Zhao) may lose fractions at each exchange

### 5. Last-Event-Ever Motivation
- This is potentially the final Nordic Combined event in Olympic history (NC removed from 2030 program)
- Emotional weight could inspire or overwhelm athletes
- Most affected: Watabe (retiring), Rydzek (5-time Olympian, likely final Games), Costa (came out of retirement for this)
- Veterans may race with "nothing to lose" freedom — or may tighten up under the historic pressure

## Weather Considerations
- February in Predazzo: typical temperatures -5°C to +5°C
- Snow conditions: likely groomed artificial snow course given February timing
- Wind: Fiemme Valley can channel winds — critical for jumping phase more than XC
- If warm/soft snow: favors heavier, more powerful skiers; disadvantages lighter athletes (Yamamoto at 52kg)
- Hirvonen quote: "I've always hated this soft snow" — conditions matter for Finnish team

## Wax and Equipment Notes
- Fischer skis: Lamparter (AUT), Yamamoto (JPN), Geiger (AUT — actually uses Atomic)
- Atomic skis: Geiger (GER), Rettenegger (AUT)
- Swix wax/poles: Ilves (EST), Yamamoto (JPN)
- Leki poles: Lamparter (AUT)
- German/Austrian/Norwegian wax technicians are considered the strongest service teams — advantage to top nations in close conditions
