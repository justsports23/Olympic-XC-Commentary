# Conditions & Wax — February 8, 2026

## Weather Forecast (Race Day)
- **Air Temperature:** 5–7°C (warm for cross-country skiing)
- **Sky Conditions:** Overcast
- **Wind:** Strengthening through the day; Italian weather service warned of a cyclonic vortex
- **Precipitation:** Potential rain
- **Humidity:** Expected to be very high (women's skiathlon the previous day saw 94% humidity)

## Snow Conditions
- **Snow Temperature:** Warm (above 0°C surface expected given 5–7°C air temp)
- **Snow Type:** Wet, energy-draining snow
- **Snowmaking:** Course uses modernized snowmaking system (part of €22.4 million renovation)
- **Reference:** The women's skiathlon on February 7 was raced in wet, energy-draining snow at 5°C with 94% humidity

## Wax Implications
- **Fluorine-Free Era:** All wax must comply with the FIS fluorine ban (in effect since 2023–24 season)
- **Challenge Level:** Extremely high — warm, wet conditions are among the most difficult for wax technicians
- **Classic Kick Wax:** Critical for the first 10km. Wet snow requires precise klister or warm-condition grip wax. Too much grip = slow glide. Too little = slipping on climbs.
- **Skating Glide Wax:** Warm-snow glide wax with hydrophobic properties to repel water on the ski base
- **Team Advantage:** Norway's wax service team, with the largest budget and most extensive testing infrastructure in the sport, holds a significant advantage in these conditions
- **Brand Factors:** [DATA NOT FOUND — specific wax brand advantages not confirmed for race day]

## Impact on Race Dynamics
- Wet, slow snow reduces the advantage of pure skating specialists
- Classic technique specialists may benefit — slower conditions compress time gaps
- Wax failures can be catastrophic — a poorly waxed ski in wet conditions can add 30+ seconds over 10km
- The conditions may favor heavier, more powerful athletes who can push through energy-draining snow
