- The course is distinct from the famous Alpe Cermis climb used in the Tour de Ski finale — the Olympic skiathlon uses the lower "Course Lago" loops

## Venue History
The Cross Country and Biathlon Center Fabio Canal at Tesero has hosted:
- FIS Nordic World Ski Championships: 1991, 2003, 2013
- Tour de Ski final stages (annual)
- Multiple FIS World Cup rounds
- The venue underwent €22.4 million in renovations for the 2026 Games, including a rebuilt grandstand, underground facilities, and modernized snowmaking

## Course Impact on Race Tactics
- The 140m of climbing per lap strongly favors athletes with climbing ability
- Classic specialists (Nyenget, Niskanen, Stenshagen) can use the climbs to create separation in the first half
- Technical descents in mass-start conditions create crash risk — especially early in the race
- The course is NOT the Alpe Cermis climb; it is a rolling loop course that rewards consistent power rather than pure climbing
