## Format Description
All 75 athletes start simultaneously in a mass start. The first 10km is raced in classic (diagonal stride/double pole) technique on approximately 3 laps of a 3.5km course. Athletes then enter individual transition boxes in the stadium where their skating skis and poles are pre-positioned. After changing equipment, they complete the final 10km in freestyle (skating) technique. The first athlete to cross the finish line wins.

This is the first Olympic Games where men and women race identical skiathlon distances — the women also raced 10km + 10km the previous day (February 7). At previous Olympics (Sochi 2014, PyeongChang 2018, Beijing 2022), the men's skiathlon was 30km (15km + 15km).
