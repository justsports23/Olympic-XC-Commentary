## Personal Life
- **Parents:** From Michigan (father from Grayling, mother from Traverse City). Moved to Anchorage, Alaska, "as a two-year thing" — and stayed. Hunter spent summers in Michigan canoe racing with extended family. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/hunter-wonders-flying-by-instrument/)
- **Education:** Bachelor's in business administration from Alaska Pacific University [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/hunter-wonders-flying-by-instrument/)
- **Retirement & Comeback:** Stepped away from World Cup racing in his early-to-mid 20s because "he wasn't having fun on the road in Europe, being away from home, friends, loved ones, and family." Returned with renewed perspective. [US Ski and Snowboard](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/wonders-retires-world-cup-cross-country-ski-racing)
- **Aviation:** Has his pilot's license and is working on his instrument rating. Completed a solo flight in Alaska. Won a Take Flight Textron Aviation scholarship. Aviation entered his life "not as a hobby, but as a parallel discipline" — it gave him "a way to be committed to skiing without being consumed by it."
