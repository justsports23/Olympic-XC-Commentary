## Personal Life
- **Family:** Father **Magnus Gisselman** runs **Twin Rill**, a company that develops ski structure tools. He joked to Sveriges Radio that as a child, Truls "mostly made snow angels" rather than showing signs of becoming a competitive skier. Mother **Petra Nordh** was training for the **Vasaloppet** (Sweden's famous 90km marathon) when young Truls and his sister started tagging along on skis — that's how he fell in love with the sport [Sveriges Radio](https://www.sverigesradio.se) [SVT Sport](https://www.svt.se/sport)
- **Hometown:** Born in **Bollnäs**, Hälsingland, Sweden. Now lives in **Falun** where he trains with the DSA Elit (Dala Sports Academy) group
- **Started skiing at ~12** when his mother's Vasaloppet training drew him and his sister onto the trails — relatively late for a Swedish elite skier. His family helped found the cross-country section of **Rehns BK**, his club, around the same time
- **Education:** Attended **Mora Skidgymnasium** (Sweden's renowned ski high school)
- **Relationship:** Dating **Barbora Antošová**, a Czech cross-country sprint specialist who competes on the World Cup circuit. They met at competitions and the relationship provides "extra motivation" to qualify for World Cup events so they can be together more [Sportbibeln](https://www.sportbibeln.se) [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com)
- **WCH underdog story:** Was a reserve at the 2025 Worlds in Trondheim. When veteran Calle Halfvarsson fell ill the day before the relay, the 23-year-old was suddenly thrust into the first leg. He delivered a stunning performance, helping Sweden to bronze. "Almost so I can't believe it myself" [SVT Sport](https://www.svt.se/sport)
- **Philosophy:** "You have to be as disrespectful as possible" — meaning don't be overawed by bigger names [Långd.se](https://langd.se)
- **Club loyalty:** Despite reaching the World Championship podium, has stayed with Rehns BK — the small club his family helped build
