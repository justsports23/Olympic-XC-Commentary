## Key Storylines
- Defending Olympic skiathlon bronze medalist (Beijing 2022) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iivo_Niskanen)
- At 34, likely his final Olympics
- Oberhof 2nd shows classic form is sharp
- The shortened 20km format (only 10km of freestyle instead of old 15km) may benefit him — reduces freestyle exposure
- If conditions remain slow and wet, classic specialists like Niskanen could gain an advantage
- His 2022 Olympic skiathlon bronze came via a strong classic half
