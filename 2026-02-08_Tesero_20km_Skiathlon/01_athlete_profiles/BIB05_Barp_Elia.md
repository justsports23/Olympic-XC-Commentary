## Personal Life

Grandfather Serafino (born 1943) founded the ski club "Gruppo Fondisti Poiana di Trichiana." Brother Dante (born 2007) also competes in cross-country skiing.

- **Family Sacrifice:** When young Elia showed top-level potential, his entire family relocated from Belluno to Falcade (below Passo San Pellegrino) to facilitate his training.

- **Youth Sport:** Originally started in road cycling. Cross-country skiing began as his way to stay fit during winter — then it took over. His father recounts that Elia eventually said "I want to come ski with you."
