## Personal Life
- **Father's Death:** Won his first World Cup race (Oslo 50km classic, 2022) just two days after attending his father's funeral. Pointed to the sky when crossing the finish line. "We were best friends, and he was the best dad in the world." [Inside the Games](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1120173/nyenget-first-cross-country-world-cup) [TV2](https://www.tv2.no/sport/pappaeffekt-en-boost/17221063/)
- **Wife & Daughter:** Married Synne Baklid Nyenget in spring 2023. First child (daughter) born April 2023. Credits fatherhood with boosting his performance — the "papa effect." [TV2](https://www.tv2.no/sport/pappaeffekt-en-boost/17221063/) [Nettavisen](https://www.nettavisen.no/sport/pappalivet-ga-martin-lowstrom-nyenget-et-loft-vet-hva-det-innebarer/s/5-95-2206909)
- **On His Wife:** "She deserves a lot of the credit for making it possible for me to ski, because she facilitates everything. The day I'm done skiing, I'll put my ego aside and make up for what I can't do now." [Nettavisen](https://www.nettavisen.no/sport/pappalivet-ga-martin-lowstrom-nyenget-et-loft-vet-hva-det-innebarer/s/5-95-2206909)
