## Personal Life
- **Hometown:** Born in **Pärnu**, Estonia. Started skiing at age 7 with the **Joulu Ski Club** (Suusaklubi Joulu)
- **Education:** Graduated from **Audentese Sports Gymnasium** in Otepää (2013), then earned a degree in physical education from the **University of Tartu** (2023).

- **International journey:** Has lived in Estonia, the USA, and Norway in pursuit of his skiing career — each move representing a search for the best training methods. Moved to Norway ~2019/2020 to train with **Team OBOS** under Norwegian coach **Eivind Tonna** (a former ski-orienteering medalist)
- **Resource disparity:** The gap between small and large skiing nations is starkly illustrated by Alev's experience. A FasterSkier article memorably noted: "Norway had 10 wax techs. Estonia had a fanny pack and a borrowed wax bench" [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com)
- **Coach's perspective:** Tonna has noted that Alev missed "thousands of training hours" in his childhood compared to Norwegian skiers, but believes a top-10 Olympic finish is realistic [Postimees](https://sport.postimees.ee)
- **Estonia's strongest skier:** Carries the hopes of an entire nation's XC skiing program. His ambition is explicitly not to stay at his current level but to keep improving toward the top 10
