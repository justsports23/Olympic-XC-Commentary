## Key Storylines
- Despite winning the Crystal Globe in 2023–24, this is his first Olympics — testament to Norwegian depth
- "As a Norwegian men's skier, the biggest thing is almost to make it into the Olympic squad" [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- Bronzed in the Trondheim skiathlon — the direct format rehearsal for this race
- Twin brother of cross-country skier Hedda Østberg Amundsen [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_%C3%98stberg_Amundsen)
- At 27, in his prime athletic years

## Personal Life
- **Twin Sister:** Hedda Østberg Amundsen, also a cross-country skier on the Norwegian national team. They are known as the "turbo twins." Won a mixed relay together at U23 World Championships. Not identical twins. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedda_%C3%98stberg_Amundsen) [Madshus](https://madshus.com/en-us/blog/p/the-stuff-that-champions-are-made-of)
- **Childhood:** Grew up in Asker, outside Oslo. Harald was the one who wanted to start cross-country skiing; Hedda joined because their parents thought it was practical for the twins to do the same activity. [Issuu/Livein](https://issuu.com/maglin25/docs/livein_02_2020/s/11299580)
- **Education:** Deliberately chose general studies in high school with no sports subjects — not the elite sports high school. Believed it was good "to think about something other than just training and skiing all the time." Has taken economics courses alongside skiing. [Issuu/Livein](https://issuu.com/maglin25/docs/livein_02_2020/s/11299580)
- **Friends Outside Skiing:** Both twins emphasize having friends outside the ski community — unusual in Norwegian elite skiing culture
- **Sibling Rivalry:** Constant competition between the twins motivates both. They have a well-developed competitive instinct. [Issuu/Livein](https://issuu.com/maglin25/docs/livein_02_2020/s/11299580)
- **Historic Parallel:** At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, their sibling predecessors Iivo and Kerttu Niskanen (FIN) both medaled. Could Harald and Hedda follow the same script?
