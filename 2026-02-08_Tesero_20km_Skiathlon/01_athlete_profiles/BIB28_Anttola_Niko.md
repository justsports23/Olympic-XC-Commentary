## Personal Life
- **Family:** Father **Marko Anttola** is his personal coach — a former youth national team-level skier who served as **ski technician for Mika Myllylä at the 1998 Nagano Olympics** (where Myllylä won gold in the 30km classic). Marko holds Finland's highest coaching certification and was named Finnish Coach of the Month. Mother **Heli Anttola** is described as an "invaluable emotional support pillar" — she was overcome with emotion trackside at the 2023 Planica Worlds when Niko anchored Finland to relay silver: "It feels absolutely unbelievable" [YLE](https://yle.fi) [Suomen Valmentajat](https://www.suomenvalmentajat.fi)
- **Older sister** also competes in cross-country skiing at the Finnish national level — "skiing truly runs in the Anttola blood"
- **Hometown:** Born in **Tornio**, on the Finnish-Swedish border in Lapland
- **Education:** Graduated from **Sotkamo Sports High School** in Vuokatti — the same institution that produced Olympic champions Iivo Niskanen and Kaisa Mäkäräinen. Completed military service at **Kainuu Brigade's Sports School** in 2023 [YLE](https://yle.fi)
- **Golf:** A passionate golfer introduced to the sport by his father. Competed seriously on regional junior golf circuits in northern Finland with a handicap around 6 and drives reaching 280 meters. Now plays casually as a summer hobby [Golfpiste](https://golfpiste.com)
- **2025 WCH relay heartbreak:** Called in as a last-minute replacement for the ill Ville Ahonen at Trondheim, then crashed on the fastest downhill. Was devastated — said stone-faced: "I'll pack my bags so I can go home tomorrow." Veteran teammate Hakola (Bib 27) comforted him afterward [Iltalehti](https://www.iltalehti.fi)
- **Character:** Described as analytical and process-oriented: "I expect quite a lot from myself." Does not have a single role model but admires athletes who "set ambitious goals and put in a lot of effort" [Maastohiihto](https://maastohiihto.com)
