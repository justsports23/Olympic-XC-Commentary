- His ceiling is very high (WC #2 last year) but hasn't reached it this season

## Personal Life
- **Family Tragedy:** Younger sister Stina was born when Edvin was three years old but died at six months of age from a congenital illness. Just months earlier, his paternal grandfather had also died of cancer in his mid-50s. His parents believe the loss shaped him — mother Ellinor says: "He became a caring person."
