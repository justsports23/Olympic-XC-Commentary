## Personal Life
- **Family:** Father **Dieter Notz** competed at the **1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid** (15km event) and narrowly missed a relay medal — Florian is a second-generation Olympian. Dieter later became an elite distance runner (20th at the 1988 Berlin Marathon, 7th at the Munich Marathon). Younger brother **Dominik Notz** is a professional long-distance runner (half marathon PB 1:03:45) — making the Notz family a remarkable multi-sport, multi-generation dynasty [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com) [World Athletics](https://worldathletics.org)
- **Hometown:** Born in **Dettingen an der Erms**, a small town (~10,000 people) on the **Swabian Alps** (Schwäbische Alb), about 40 km south of Stuttgart — far from the alpine stereotypes of German winter sport [floriannotz.de](http://floriannotz.de)
- **Club:** SZ Römerstein — a small local club where cross-country skiing is the signature discipline. Florian has stayed loyal to his hometown club throughout his career
- **Education:** Attended the prestigious **Skiinternat Furtwangen** (Ski Boarding School in the Black Forest) alongside future champions like Simon Schempp and Benedikt Doll. Completed his Abitur in 2011 [xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de)
- **Career:** Joined the **Zoll Ski Team** (German Customs) immediately after school, holding the rank of Zolloberwachtmeister (customs officer) [Zoll](https://www.zoll.de)
- **Youth training:** His coach Dieter Winkler emphasized fun and versatility — every training session ended with a football match. Florian credits this approach for keeping him in the sport
- **Life motto:** "In der Ruhe liegt die Kraft" ("Strength lies in calmness") and "Everything is hard before it gets easy" [floriannotz.de](http://floriannotz.de)
- **Greatest personal achievement:** Says his 8th place in the 50km at Holmenkollen means more to him than his U23 World Championship gold
