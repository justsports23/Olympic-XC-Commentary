## Key Observations
- Norway has won 7 of 18 total medals (3 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze)
- No nation has won back-to-back skiathlon golds
- The defending champion Alexander Bolshunov (ROC/Russia) is not competing due to neutral athlete restrictions
- Iivo Niskanen (FIN, Bib 12) is the only returning medalist in the field (bronze 2022)
- The race at 20km (vs. 30km) may produce different dynamics than recent editions
