# Stories Worth Telling — The 75 Humans Behind the Bibs

The beauty of the Olympic skiathlon isn't just the battle for gold. It's 75 people from 38 countries — from Norway to Haiti, from Finland to Thailand — all on the same start line. These are the stories that make this race about more than podiums.

## "We Have to Be Taken Seriously" — Stevenson Savart (HAI, Bib 71)

Stevenson Savart was born in Delmas, Haiti. Adopted by a French family at age three, he grew up in France and discovered skiing. When he couldn't qualify for the French national team, he turned to the country of his birth — and became Haiti's first-ever Olympic cross-country skier. [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/haiti-stevenson-savart-milano-cortina-2026/)

He carried Haiti's flag at the opening ceremony in Predazzo, wearing a uniform designed by Italian-Haitian designer Stella Jean. The original design featured Toussaint Louverture — the formerly enslaved man who led the revolution that created the world's first Black republic in 1804. The IOC ruled the image violated rules against political symbolism, and Jean was forced to paint over Haiti's founding father. The controversy only amplified the team's visibility. [Haitian Times](https://haitiantimes.com/2026/02/07/haiti-flag-bearer-winter-olympics-2026/) [WMTW](https://www.wmtw.com/article/haitis-winter-olympics-team-shines-positive-light-even-as-ioc-removes-patriot-from-uniforms/70277147)

Savart competed at the 2025 Nordic World Championships in Trondheim — the spiritual home of the sport. His goal today: finish the race. Maybe crack the top 50. But his larger mission is unambiguous: "Athletes from so-called 'exotic' countries can do winter sports without being laughed at. We have to be taken seriously. That's one of my objectives." [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/haiti-stevenson-savart-milano-cortina-2026/)

Haiti, racked by political violence and humanitarian crisis, has two winter Olympians in Italy. This is one of them.

## Three Generations of Skis — Xavier McKeever (CAN, Bib 35)

When Xavier McKeever lines up at Bib 35, he carries a family legacy that spans Olympic and Paralympic history. His mother, Milaine Theriault, was an Olympic cross-country skier who competed in Turin 2006. His father, Robin McKeever, raced at the 1998 Nagano Olympics before becoming the guide for his visually impaired brother — Xavier's uncle — Brian McKeever. [Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/xavier-mckeever/) [CBC Kids News](https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews/post/skier-xavier-mckeever-on-growing-up-in-a-family-of-olympians)

Brian McKeever went on to become Canada's most decorated Winter Paralympian of all time: 20 medals including 16 gold. Robin guided him to 10 of those medals before becoming the team's coach. [Canadian Paralympic Committee](https://paralympic.ca/athlete/brian-mckeever/) [Paralympic.org](https://www.paralympic.org/feature/pioneers-brian-mckeever-para-cross-country-skiing)

Xavier's Olympic origin story traces to a specific moment: watching his father and uncle compete and win at the Vancouver 2010 Paralympic Games. "My decision to become a skier was created at the Vancouver 2010 Paralympic Games," he said. Now, 16 years later, the 22-year-old is a second-generation Olympian. It's "pretty surreal to be able to race in Italy at the Olympics, 20 years" after watching his mom race in Turin. [Nordiq Canada](https://nordiqcanada.ca/news-item/team-canadas-milano-cortina-2026-cross-country-skiing-team-unveiled/) [CBC Sports](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/cross-country-skiing/cross-country-xavier-mckeever-profile-1.6732998)

Brian, now retired, is coaching. "I get to be on the other side of the fence now," he says. Three McKeever generations, two Olympic teams, one Paralympic dynasty. [CBC Sports](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/cross-country-skiing/cross-country-xavier-mckeever-profile-1.6732998)

## The Galwegian Norwegian — Thomas Maloney Westgaard (IRL, Bib 36)

Thomas Maloney Westgaard grew up on Leka, a tiny Norwegian island of 600 people. His father Ove was Norwegian. His mother Celia is from Dunmore, County Galway, Ireland — she moved to Norway 35 years ago after meeting Ove on a sun holiday in the Canary Islands. [RTE](https://amp.rte.ie/amp/1191478/) [Connacht Tribune](https://connachttribune.ie/galways-record-breaking-olympian-651/)

Westgaard represents Ireland, making him the sporting bridge between two countries that couldn't be more different in their relationship to snow. He's coached by retired Norwegian legend Frode Estil (Olympic champion, 2002 Salt Lake City). He trains in Trondheim. But the green on his suit is Irish. [Team Ireland](https://olympics.ie/introducing-thomas-maloney-westgaard-cross-country-skiing-2/) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Maloney_Westg%C3%A5rd)

At the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, a dozen family members flew from Ireland to South Korea to cheer him on. But what few knew was the turmoil behind the scenes: his beloved father Ove was terminally ill with cancer. Ove passed away three months after those Games, aged 66. [RTE](https://amp.rte.ie/amp/1191478/)

At Beijing 2022, Westgaard produced a stunning 14th place in the 15km classic — Ireland's best-ever Olympic cross-country result. Milano Cortina is his third Games. His dream: to become the first Irish winter Olympic medallist. [Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/thomas-maloney-westgaard-ends-ireland-s-olympics-by-achieving-top-30-goal-1.4807260) [RTE](https://www.rte.ie/sport/other-sport/2026/0129/1555828-team-ireland-confirms-lineup-for-winter-olympic-games/)

## From Bogota to the Start Line — Fredrik Fodstad (COL, Bib 64)

Fredrik Gerardo Fodstad was born in Bogota, Colombia, in 2001. Adopted as an infant by a Norwegian couple, Bente and Ole Torbjorn Fodstad, he grew up in Scandinavia on skis. He competed for Norway until 2021, then switched his national affiliation to Colombia — the country of his birth. [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-colombias-fredrik-fodstad-south-africas-matthew-smith-and-liechtensteins-robin-frommelt-selected-for-the-2026-olympics-0121/) [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/39513)

He is the fourth Colombian athlete in history to compete at a Winter Olympics. At the opening ceremony, he carried the Colombian flag. He was also the only member of his delegation competing. [El Tiempo](https://www.eltiempo.com/deportes/ciclo-olimpico/asi-fue-la-presentacion-de-colombia-en-la-ceremonia-inaugural-de-los-juegos-olimpicos-de-invierno-2026-el-esquiador-fredrik-fodstad-ondeo-la-bandera-3530408)

Today he races the skiathlon, the 10km distance, and the sprint. There is no Colombian wax team. There is no Colombian skiing federation infrastructure. There is just Fodstad, his Norwegian training, and a Colombian flag.

---

## A Finnish Name in La Paz — Timo Juhani Gronlund (BOL, Bib 72)

At 38 years old, Timo Juhani Gronlund is the oldest athlete in the entire field. He is Finnish by birth. He is Bolivian by marriage and by choice. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timo_Juhani_Gr%C3%B6nlund) [Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/136790)

Gronlund married a Bolivian woman in 2011 and moved to La Paz — one of the highest cities in the world at 3,640 meters — in 2014. He represents Club Andino. He first competed for Bolivia internationally in 2017 and made his Olympic debut at PyeongChang 2018. Beijing 2022 was his second Games (89th in the 15km classic). Milano Cortina is his third. [Bolivia at 2026 Olympics — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics) [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=225381)

Bolivia has no cross-country skiing infrastructure. There are no groomed trails, no wax rooms, no federation coaches. There is a Finnish man who fell in love, moved to the Andes, and skis for his adopted country. He will not contend for a medal. He will almost certainly finish last or near last. But he will finish — and Bolivia will have been represented.

## Siblings on Different Slopes — Mark Chanloung (THA, Bib 68)

Mark Chanloung was born in Gressoney-La-Trinite, a tiny village in Italy's Aosta Valley, to an Italian mother and a Thai father. He and his sister Karen grew up skiing in the Alps. They represent Thailand. [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/athlete365/news/milano-cortina2026/karen-and-mark-chanloung-skiing-siblings-putting-thailand-on-the-map) [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/thailand-chanloung-siblings-home-milano-cortina-2026)

This is Mark's third Olympics (PyeongChang 2018, Beijing 2022, Milano Cortina 2026). Karen is competing in the women's 10km. Together, the Chanloung siblings have almost single-handedly built Thailand's cross-country skiing program. Seven years ago, Thailand had 40 winter sports athletes. By 2024, there are 265 — partly inspired by the Chanlougs. Thailand even won its first Winter Youth Olympic medal (monobob silver, 2024). [Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20250208/03eb9c59a1cf47aea8dd04f8f02219df/c.html) [Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/sports/3185390/thailands-skiing-siblings-return-home-for-winter-games)

Today Mark races in the country where he was born, representing the country of his father. Karen raced yesterday. Their parents are in the stands. [Nation Thailand](https://www.nationthailand.com/blogs/news/sport/40046192)

## Five Olympics and Counting — Paul Constantin Pepene (ROU, Bib 49)

Paul Pepene was born in Brasov, Romania, on May 21, 1988. He started with biathlon at age 10 before switching to cross-country skiing. In 2010, he won gold at the U23 World Championships in the 30km pursuit. [Olympics Fandom](https://olympics.fandom.com/wiki/Paul_Constantin_Pepene) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Constantin_Pepene)

Today, at 37, he becomes the first Romanian athlete to compete in five Winter Olympic Games in cross-country skiing (Vancouver 2010, Sochi 2014, PyeongChang 2018, Beijing 2022, Milano Cortina 2026). He was Romania's flag bearer at the Beijing 2022 opening ceremony, and again at the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony alongside teammate Daniela Toth. [Romfilatelia](https://romfilatelia.ro/en/team-romania-at-the-milano-cortina-2026-olympic-games/) [Romania Journal](https://www.romaniajournal.ro/sports/romanian-athletes-full-schedule-at-2026-winter-olympics-in-milan-cortina/) [RRI](https://www.rri.ro/en/athlete-of-the-week/athletes-of-the-week-on-rri-raluca-stramaturaru-valentin-cretu-and-paul-pepene-id978415.html)

He's also a two-time silver medalist at the Roller Ski World Championships — a summer discipline that keeps ski-starved athletes race-sharp when there's no snow. Alongside him on the Romanian team: Gabriel Cojocaru (Bib 59), born in 2003 — 15 years Pepene's junior. The old guard and the next generation, shoulder to shoulder.

## The Kid From CU Boulder — Jakob Elias Moch (GER, Bib 43)

At 19 years and 353 days old, Jakob Moch is the youngest athlete in the entire skiathlon field. He is a freshman at the University of Colorado, studying business. Two weeks before the Olympics, he was competing in NCAA college races for the CU Buffaloes. [CU Buffs Athletics](https://cubuffs.com/news/2026/1/20/skiing-cu-freshman-jakob-moch-named-to-german-olympic-team-for-2026-winter-games) [CU Buffs Athletics](https://cubuffs.com/news/2026/2/5/general-cu-2026-winter-olympic-preview-watch-guide)

He's also Friedrich Moch's (Bib 18) little brother. Friedrich is Germany's top male cross-country skier and a perennial Alpe Cermis contender. Jakob followed him into the sport and exploded onto the scene: two Youth Olympic Games golds in Gangwon 2024 (7.5km classic and mixed relay), a Junior Worlds bronze, and then a stunning 21st place on his World Cup debut at Davos — the youngest skier in the top 100 by two full years. [Denver 7](https://www.denver7.com/sports/here-are-the-colorado-athletes-competing-in-the-2026-winter-olympics) [CU Buffs Athletics](https://cubuffs.com/sports/skiing/roster/jakob-moch/18051)

He's the 45th Olympian in Colorado's storied ski program history and the first to represent Germany. He flew from an NCAA race at the Utah Invitational (where he finished 2nd, 8.5 seconds behind the winner) directly to Italy. [CU Buffs Athletics](https://cubuffs.com/news/2026/1/24/skiing-nordic-ski-buffs-take-lead-at-utah-invitational)

## From Chile's Flag Bearer to Norway's Shadows — Sebastian Endrestad (CHI, Bib 69)

Sebastian Endrestad was born in Lorenskog, Norway, in 1998. He competed for Norway from 2015 to 2021. In a country where making the national team requires beating dozens of world-class skiers, Endrestad faced a choice: remain a Norwegian athlete who never makes the Olympics, or represent his heritage. He chose Chile. [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=198035&type=result) [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/es/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/quien-es-sebastian-endrestad-milano-cortina-2026/)

It proved transformative. Within a year of switching, he was competing in World Cup sprints. By 2023, he was at the World Championships. Now he's Chile's flag bearer at the Milano Cortina Olympics, alongside Matilde Schwencke. [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/es/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/quien-es-sebastian-endrestad-milano-cortina-2026/)

His story mirrors Fodstad's (Colombia, born in Bogota, raised in Norway) and Maloney Westgaard's (Ireland, raised in Norway) — the diaspora of Norwegian skiing culture spreading representation to countries that would otherwise have none.

## The Man Who Almost Quit — Mattis Stenshagen (NOR, Bib 3)

Mattis Stenshagen is #3 in the World Cup distance standings and won the Tour de Ski final climb at this exact venue five weeks ago. But in the spring of 2025, he was ready to walk away from the sport. "I was very close to giving up," he said. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/works-for-his-ultra-wealthy-relative-earns-almost-nothing-from-skiing/) [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/olympic-selection-beckons-for-stenshagen-after-winning-final-climb)

Despite being one of Norway's best skiers, Stenshagen is not on the national A-team. He is self-funded. He earns almost nothing from skiing. To finance his career, he works part-time in finance for a distant relative, Egil Stenshagen — a 78-year-old former rallycross champion turned billionaire investor who reported pre-tax profits of roughly €111 million in 2024. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/works-for-his-ultra-wealthy-relative-earns-almost-nothing-from-skiing/)

Stenshagen studies alongside training, follows the stock market in his spare time, and practices extreme self-discipline — including self-imposed isolation over Christmas to avoid getting sick before the Olympics. He had only one career World Cup podium before this season. Now he has four. He is 29 years old, and this is his first Olympics. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/12/stenshagen-sets-the-pace-in-toblach-as-the-mens-tour-takes-shape/) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattis_Stenshagen)

Even Klæbo — his teammate and the greatest cross-country skier alive — has said: "If there's anyone I really want to see win, it's Mattis." [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-20km-skiathlon/)

## The Dual-Citizen Diaspora — A Pattern Across the Field

One of the most striking features of this start list is how many athletes were born in one country and race for another. It reveals the global diffusion of Nordic skiing culture — and the hard mathematical reality that only four Norwegians can race the skiathlon:

| Athlete | Bib | Born In | Races For | Connection |
|---------|-----|---------|-----------|------------|
| Thomas Maloney Westgaard | 36 | Norway | Ireland | Irish mother from Galway |
| Sebastian Endrestad | 69 | Norway | Chile | Chilean heritage |
| Fredrik Fodstad | 64 | Colombia | Colombia | Born in Bogota, raised in Norway |
| Mark Chanloung | 68 | Italy | Thailand | Thai father, Italian mother |
| Timo Gronlund | 72 | Finland | Bolivia | Married a Bolivian, moved to La Paz |
| Joe Davies | 31 | Canada | Great Britain | Half-British, grew up in Pemberton, BC |

These athletes expand what cross-country skiing looks like. They bring the Haitian flag, the Thai flag, the Colombian flag, the Irish flag to a sport historically dominated by the Nordics. None of them will likely medal today. All of them matter.

## Rivalry Across Borders — Not Just Norway vs. Everyone

While Norway dominates the World Cup, the depth of competition at the Olympics tells a different story:

- **France** fields four skiers (Lapalus, Desloges, Lapierre, Lovera) and has produced multiple Tour de Ski climbers and WCH medalists
- **Finland** counters with Niskanen (3 Olympic golds), Ruuskanen (U23 World Champion), Hakola, and Anttola
- **Sweden** has Poromaa (WCH 50km silver), Anger (WC #2 last season), Berglund, and Gisselman
- **Italy** fields Pellegrino (the flag bearer, 2-time Olympic silver medalist), Barp, Graz, and Carollo on home snow
- **USA** brings Schumacher (WC #10, best American TdS ever), Ketterson, McMullen, and Wonders
- **Canada** sends four (Cyr, McKeever, Drolet, Hollmann) including the continuation of the McKeever family dynasty
- **Germany** has the Moch brothers — Friedrich (26) and Jakob (19), the oldest and youngest athletes from the same nation
- **Czech Republic** brings three: Novak (2023 WC podium finisher), Bauer, and Ophoff
- **Great Britain** has Musgrave (5th Olympics, 7th in 2018 skiathlon) and Davies (NCAA standout)
- **Switzerland** fields Klee (breakthrough season, 7 WC top-10s) and Wigger

Every nation has a story. Every athlete earned their place on this start line. The gap between Bib 1 and Bib 75 is measured in time, but not in effort.
