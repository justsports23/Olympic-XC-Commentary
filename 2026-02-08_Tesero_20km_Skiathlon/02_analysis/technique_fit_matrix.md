# Technique Fit Matrix — Men's 10km + 10km Skiathlon

## Race Demands
This specific race demands the following attributes, weighted by importance:

| Attribute | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Classic technique | 25% | First 10km in classic; 3 laps of 3.5km with 140m climb |
| Freestyle/skating technique | 25% | Final 10km in skating; decisive phase |
| Climbing ability | 20% | 140m elevation per lap; ~840m total climbing |
| Sprint finish | 15% | Shortened 20km format likely produces group finish |
| Tactical racing | 10% | Mass start with 75 athletes; positioning critical |
| Transition speed | 5% | Ski change in individual boxes |

## Key Observations

### Athletes Best Suited to This Specific Race
1. **Klæbo (9.1)** — The only athlete with no significant weakness across any dimension
2. **Amundsen (8.2)** — Strong all-rounder with skating and tactical edge
3. **Pellegrino (8.2)** — Surprising fit due to classic strength, elite sprint, and supreme tactical ability
4. **Stenshagen (7.9)** — Elite classic and climbing perfectly match the first half; skating weakness is the only concern
5. **Vermeulen (7.8)** — If healthy, his climbing ability and dual-technique competence fit the course perfectly

### Race Demand Mismatches
- **Nyenget and Niskanen** (classic specialists): The skating half and sprint finish requirements reduce their overall fit despite elite classic scores
- **Schumacher and Desloges** (freestyle specialists): The classic-first format means they must survive 10km in their weaker technique before they can unleash their skating
- **Lapierre** (climber): The Olympic course is not the Alpe Cermis — while climbing matters, the loop format requires all-round ability

### Conditions Modifier
In the warm, wet conditions forecast (5–7°C, potential rain):
- Classic kick wax becomes more important → **benefits classic specialists** (+0.5 for Niskanen, Nyenget, Stenshagen)
- Wet snow slows skating speed → **reduces skating specialist advantage** (-0.3 for Schumacher, Anger)
- Wax team quality becomes critical → **benefits Norway, disadvantages smaller nations**
