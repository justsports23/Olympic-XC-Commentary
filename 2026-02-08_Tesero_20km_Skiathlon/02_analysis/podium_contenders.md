# Podium Contenders — Men's 10km + 10km Skiathlon

## Gold Favorite

### Johannes Høsflot Klæbo (NOR, Bib 1)
**Probability: Very High**

There is no suspense about the favorite. Klæbo leads the overall, distance, and sprint World Cup standings simultaneously — the most complete cross-country skier alive. [proxcskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-20km-skiathlon/)

**Case for gold:**
- Won the season's only WC skiathlon (Trondheim, Dec 6 — 43:49.4, by 0.7s over Amundsen) [fis-ski](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- Dominated the Tour de Ski (5th title, record-breaking, 4 of 6 stages won) [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- Won both races at Goms (sprint classic + 20km classic mass start) [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-20km-skiathlon/)
- 2025 World Champion in skiathlon [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-country_skiing_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_20_kilometre_skiathlon)
- His classic technique has improved immensely — he beat classic specialists in the Goms 20km classic mass start
- The 20km format (vs. previous 30km) reduces overall demand, playing to his speed
- Unbeatable sprint finish ensures he wins any group finish scenario

**Only vulnerability:** His 2018 Olympic skiathlon (10th place) is the only notable blemish, and his classic improvement since then has been massive. The Alpe Cermis final climb (12th) shows steep sustained climbs remain his relative weakness — but the Olympic loop is not the Alpe Cermis climb.

## Silver/Bronze Contenders

### Harald Østberg Amundsen (NOR, Bib 2)
**Medal Probability: High**

Klæbo's closest rival all season. The 2023–24 Crystal Globe winner knows how to peak for major events. [Nordic Numbers](https://www.nordicnumbers.com)

**Case for medal:**
- 0.7s behind Klæbo in the Trondheim skiathlon — the direct format rehearsal [fis-ski](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- Bronze at 2025 WCH skiathlon [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- Won Ruka 20km freestyle mass start (season opener) [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-20km-skiathlon/)
- 3rd overall at Tour de Ski (+1:08.2) [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- Skating strength and tactical intelligence make him a natural podium threat
- At 27, in prime athletic years

**Risk factor:** First Olympics — Olympic pressure is an unknown variable.

### Mattis Stenshagen (NOR, Bib 3)
**Medal Probability: Strong**

Won the Tour de Ski final climb at this exact venue five weeks ago and beat Klæbo by 8.9 seconds in a TdS classic stage. [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com) [Olympics](https://www.olympics.com)

**Case for medal:**
- Won TdS final climb at Val di Fiemme (33:25.5, Jan 4) — course knowledge is elite [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- Beat Klæbo by 8.9s in TdS Toblach 10km classic [Olympics](https://www.olympics.com)
- 2nd overall at TdS (+30.1s behind Klæbo) [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- Best Climber bib (purple jersey) — the Tesero 140m climbing loops suit his profile
- Classic-first format lets him exploit his strongest technique early

**Risk factor:** Can he defend a classic-built lead in the skating half? His freestyle is improving (3rd Davos 10km free) but it's not at the Norwegian top level. If the race stays together through the transition, his sprint is not competitive against Klæbo.

### Martin Løwstrøm Nyenget (NOR, Bib 4)
**Medal Probability: Moderate-Strong**

The classic specialist who silvered in the 2025 WCH skiathlon (+0.74s behind winner) and won two 10km classic races this season. [fis-ski](https://www.fis-ski.com)

**Case for medal:**
- 2025 WCH skiathlon silver — lost by just 0.74s [fis-ski](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- Won Ruka 10km classic IS and Oberhof 10km classic IS (21:09.1) this season [fis-ski](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- Gamble of skipping TdS for Olympic-specific training could deliver peak fitness
- Powerful double-poling and pacing ability in classic

**Risk factor:** Skipping the Tour de Ski means less racing sharpness. "He doesn't have the sprint of Klæbo or Amundsen" [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-20km-skiathlon/) — needs to break clear before the final sprint.

---

### Federico Pellegrino (ITA, Bib 11)
**Medal Probability: Moderate (Dark Horse for Podium)**

The emotional wildcard. His 2nd in last year's Val di Fiemme TdS skiathlon and 4th at the WCH skiathlon prove he belongs. [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com) [Nordic Numbers](https://www.nordicnumbers.com)

**Case for medal:**
- 2nd in 2024–25 Val di Fiemme TdS skiathlon at this venue
- 4th at 2025 WCH skiathlon (missed bronze by 20cm) [Nordic Numbers](https://www.nordicnumbers.com)
- Italy's flag bearer, four-time Olympian, racing final Games on home snow
- Tactical brilliance and ability to "hang on" [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-20km-skiathlon/)
- Home crowd energy is a real factor at Tesero
- Classic-first format aligns with his strongest technique

**Risk factor:** At 35, his body must hold up over 20km against younger rivals. WC #4 overall is primarily sprint points — distance fitness is unproven at the very top level over a full season.

## Summary Prediction

| Rank | Athlete | Nation | Rationale |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Gold | Johannes Høsflot Klæbo | NOR | Dominant across all metrics; wins group sprint scenarios |
| Silver | Harald Østberg Amundsen | NOR | Closest rival; tactical and skating strength |
| Bronze | Mattis Stenshagen | NOR | Climbing power on this course; momentum from TdS |
| 4th | Martin Løwstrøm Nyenget | NOR | Classic strength; WCH silver pedigree |
| 5th | Federico Pellegrino | ITA | Home crowd; Val di Fiemme skiathlon pedigree |

The most likely outcome is a Norwegian 1-2-3, with Klæbo sprinting clear in the final kilometers — exactly as he did in Trondheim (where Norway swept positions 1–8 in the skiathlon).
