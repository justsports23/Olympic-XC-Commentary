# Dark Horses — Men's 10km + 10km Skiathlon

Athletes outside the top favorites who could deliver a surprise podium performance.

---

## Mika Vermeulen (AUT, Bib 7)
**Threat Level: High (if healthy)**

**Case for surprise:**
- Early-season form was elite: 3rd at Ruka 10km classic, 5th at Ruka 20km freestyle MS [Weltski](https://www.weltski.com)
- First non-Norwegian in Trondheim skiathlon (9th, just +4.9s behind Klæbo) [fis-ski](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- 2nd on Alpe Cermis at Val di Fiemme (TdS 2024–25) — outstanding climbing credentials at this venue
- Cycling and Nordic Combined background provide exceptional climbing ability
- When healthy, one of the few non-Norwegians who can race with the leaders [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-20km-skiathlon/)

**Risk factor:** Christmas illness forced him to skip the entire Tour de Ski. Returned at Oberhof: 46th in 10km classic — clearly not recovered [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info). Three weeks between Oberhof and today. **A recovered Vermeulen could medal; an unrecovered one might finish 30th.**

## Gus Schumacher (USA, Bib 14)
**Threat Level: Moderate-High**

**Case for surprise:**
- WC #10 overall — America's best male distance skier [fis-ski](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- 7th overall at Tour de Ski — best-ever American TdS finish [USSki and Snowboard](https://usskiandsnowboard.org)
- Won TdS Stage 3 (2nd career WC win)
- 9th in 2025 WCH skiathlon [Team USA](https://www.teamusa.org)
- "Americans count the Olympics much higher than World Championships" — extra motivation [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-mens-20km-skiathlon/)
- Freestyle strength could carry him in the second half

**Risk factor:** 21st in Trondheim skiathlon (+1:11.0) shows he hasn't been in the top group specifically in the skiathlon format. Classic half may expose a technique gap.

**Historical context:** A top-5 or podium finish would be historic for U.S. men's cross-country — the best since Bill Koch's silver in 1976. [NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com)

## Iivo Niskanen (FIN, Bib 12)
**Threat Level: Moderate**

**Case for surprise:**
- Defending Olympic skiathlon bronze medalist (Beijing 2022) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iivo_Niskanen)
- Podiumed at Oberhof in classic (2nd, Jan 18) — form is there [fis-ski](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- 5 Olympic medals including 3 golds — championship pedigree is unmatched [Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org)
- The shortened 20km format reduces freestyle exposure — only 10km of skating instead of the old 15km
- Warm, wet conditions reduce skating speed advantages and could compress the field
- His 2022 bronze came via a dominant classic half — the same strategy applies

**Risk factor:** At 34, endurance is declining. 25th in Trondheim skiathlon (+1:16.7) shows he struggled in the most recent skiathlon. Historically loses significant time in the skating half.

## Andrew Musgrave (GBR, Bib 17)
**Threat Level: Low-Moderate (outside top 10 candidate)**

**Case for surprise:**
- 7th in PyeongChang 2018 skiathlon — best-ever British Olympic XC result, proves he elevates for the skiathlon at Olympics
- 13th in Trondheim skiathlon (+9.9s) — consistently near the top group [fis-ski](https://www.fis-ski.com)
- TdS Toblach Stage 3 bronze (3rd) — recent podium form
- 5th Olympics — unmatched championship experience for a non-traditional XC nation
- The skiathlon is demonstrably his best format

**Risk factor:** At 35, sustaining effort over 20km against younger rivals is difficult. Hasn't been on a WC podium regularly.
