# The Fittest Athletes on Earth — XC Skiing and Endurance Sport

## Why Cross-Country Skiing Produces the Fittest Humans Alive

The 75 athletes lining up in Tesero today are, measured by raw cardiovascular fitness, among the most physically capable humans on the planet. Cross-country skiing consistently produces the highest recorded VO2 max values in any sport — a direct measure of how much oxygen the body can process under maximal exertion.

The reason is simple: no other endurance sport demands simultaneous full-body output in the way skiing does. A cyclist's legs do the vast majority of work. A runner's arms swing freely. A swimmer's legs are mostly stabilizers. But a cross-country skier drives forward with legs, core, arms, shoulders, and back — all at threshold intensity, over rolling terrain, for 50 minutes to two hours. Some estimates suggest 50% of propulsion comes from the poles alone.

### The Numbers

| Sport | Elite Male VO2 Max (ml/kg/min) | Notable Records |
|-------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Cross-Country Skiing** | **85–96** | Bjørn Dæhlie: 96 (out of competition — estimated 100+ at peak) |
| Cycling | 80–90 | Oskar Svendsen: 97.5 (age 18) |
| Triathlon | 80–88 | Kristian Blummenfelt: claimed 101.1 |
| Marathon Running | 75–85 | Kilian Jornet: ~90 |
| Rowing | 68–75 | Sir Matthew Pinsent: 7.5 L/min absolute |
| Swimming | 65–70 | — |

Of the top 30 VO2 max scores ever recorded, 13 belong to Norwegians — and the list is dominated by cyclists and cross-country skiers.

Andrew Musgrave (GBR, Bib 17) has a measured VO2 max of 77 — and he's quick to point out that the superstars in his sport have numbers well above 90. [RTE](https://amp.rte.ie/amp/1191478/) [Team Ireland](https://olympics.ie/thomas-maloney-westgard-cross-country-skier-interview/)

## If You Watch the Tour de France, You Already Understand This Race

The mass-start skiathlon has more in common with a Tour de France mountain stage than almost any other winter sport event. Here's a translation guide for cycling fans:

### Drafting and the Peloton

Just like in road cycling, a tight group of skiers in a mass start benefits enormously from drafting. Research shows that aerodynamic drag reduction in a skiing pack is comparable to a cycling peloton — up to 50% less drag when tucked behind other athletes. [Frontiers in Sports and Active Living](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2022.1094254/full) [Rouleur](https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/two-wheels-good-two-skis-better-the-parallels-between-skiing-and-cycling)

This creates the same tactical calculus as cycling: do you burn energy at the front to control the pace, or do you sit in and conserve for the final sprint?

### The Breakaway vs. The Sprint Finish

In the Tour de France, only 27% of road stages are won from a breakaway — the peloton almost always catches the attackers. [EF Pro Cycling](https://www.efprocycling.com/cycling-101/tour-de-france-primer-what-is-a-breakaway/) [Frontier Economics](https://www.frontier-economics.com/uk/en/news-and-insights/articles/article-i6444-breaking-down-the-breakaway/)

The same dynamic applies here. If Stenshagen or Nyenget attack in the classic half, they're the breakaway. Klæbo, sitting comfortably in the pack with his superior skating speed, is the peloton. History says the pack usually wins. But on the right day, with the right conditions, the breakaway survives — and that's what makes it riveting.

### The Accordion Effect

Cycling fans know the "accordion effect" — when the front slows and accelerates, causing amplified surges at the back that shatter the group. The same phenomenon occurs in mass-start skiing, especially on narrow trail sections with 75 athletes. The athletes starting on bibs 40+ will experience far more violent speed changes than the leaders. [Frontiers in Sports and Active Living](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2022.1094254/full)

### Team Tactics

Norway's four skiers function like a cycling team. One rider sets pace (Nyenget or Stenshagen in classic), another covers attacks (Amundsen), while the team leader (Klæbo) saves energy for the finish — exactly as a cycling team would protect its sprinter or GC leader.

The difference: there are no earpieces in skiing. All communication is visual and instinctive.

### Key Vocabulary Translation

| Cycling Term | Skiing Equivalent |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Peloton | Lead pack / Main group |
| Breakaway | Solo or small-group attack, often on climbs |
| Domestique | Teammate who sets pace (e.g., Nyenget for Klæbo) |
| Sprint finish | Final-kilometer kick |
| Mountain stage | Skiathlon climbing loops |
| Time trial | Interval start race (not this event) |
| GC leader | Overall World Cup leader (Klæbo) |
| Green jersey (sprints) | Sprint World Cup standings |
| Polka dot jersey (climber) | Purple bib — Best Climber (Stenshagen at TdS) |
| Mechanical / flat tire | Wax failure / broken pole / binding malfunction |

## The Cross-Sport Athletes in This Field

Several athletes in today's race have direct connections to other endurance sports:

### Mika Vermeulen (AUT, Bib 7) — From Nordic Combined and Cycling

Vermeulen started in Nordic Combined (ski jumping + XC skiing), winning Junior World Championship gold in the team event and silver individually in 2017. His brother Moran is a professional road cyclist. The family's genetic endurance capacity is extraordinary — Vermeulen's climbing power on Alpe Cermis (2nd in 2024–25 TdS) is directly comparable to a cyclist's ability on an Alpine pass. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_Vermeulen) [FIS Nordic Combined](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=NK&competitorid=182843)

### Klæbo and Cycling

Johannes Høsflot Klæbo has trained with the Norwegian professional cycling team Uno-X, underscoring how the physiological demands of elite cycling and elite skiing converge at the top level. [Rouleur](https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/two-wheels-good-two-skis-better-the-parallels-between-skiing-and-cycling)

### The Svein Tuft Insight

Former Canadian professional cyclist Svein Tuft, who grew up on cross-country skis before spending a decade in the pro cycling peloton, put it simply: "Cross-country skiing incorporates every muscle, every part of the cardiac system. I don't think you can build an engine in a better way than the cross-country skiers have."

## The Transition: A Pit Stop on Skis

The ski change at the halfway mark — where athletes swap from classic to skating equipment — has no exact equivalent in cycling but is closest to a Formula 1 pit stop in concept. Athletes enter individual boxes at full race pace, unbuckle classic boots, step into skating boots, grab different poles, and rejoin the race. The fastest transitions take under 15 seconds. A fumbled binding or a ski that slides away can cost 10–20 seconds — an eternity at this level.

Unlike F1, there is no pit crew. The athlete does everything themselves.

## The Marathon Running Parallel

For runners, the closest comparison is a half-marathon raced at 10K pace — but with the added complexity of two distinct techniques. Imagine running the first 10km in a sand-filled obstacle course (classic skiing — grip wax, herringbone climbs, precise kick timing) and then switching shoes at halfway to sprint the final 10km on a road (skating — pure speed, power, and glide).

The total time for the men's 20km skiathlon will be approximately 43–50 minutes, depending on conditions. That's similar to a half-marathon finishing time for elite runners — except these athletes are skiing uphill for 840 cumulative meters of climbing. For comparison, the New York City Marathon has only 263 meters of total elevation gain over 42.2km.
