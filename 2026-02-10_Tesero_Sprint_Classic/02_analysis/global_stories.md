# The World on Skis: Global Stories Beyond the Traditional Powers

## Why This Matters for Commentary

Cross-country skiing is often perceived as a Scandinavian sport. Today's sprint field proves otherwise — athletes from **every inhabited continent** are racing on the same 1,585m course in Tesero. For a billion viewers worldwide, many tuning into XC skiing for the first and only time until 2030, these are the stories that transcend the sport.

**The traditional XC powers:** Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia (banned)
**The semi-traditional nations:** France, Italy (host), Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic
**Everyone else:** The stories below.

## TIER 1: THE HEADLINES — Stories That Could Go Viral

### Samuel Ikpefan (Nigeria) — CONFIRMED IN MEN'S SPRINT CLASSIC
**Age:** ~33 | **Born:** Annemasse, French Alps (French mother, Nigerian father from Edo State)

The most compelling underdog in today's field. Ikpefan was a **French youth sprint champion** but the doors to the senior French team closed. He obtained a Nigerian passport in 2018 and decided to represent his father's homeland. To prove his commitment, he traveled to Nigeria for the first time in his life and gave a **roller-ski demonstration in Abuja's 60,000-seat National Stadium** — broadcast on national TV.

At **Beijing 2022**, he became **Nigeria's first-ever Winter Olympian**. He contracted COVID days before his races and finished 73rd in sprint qualifying. Now he's back for a second Games — the first Nigerian to achieve that.

He **carried Nigeria's flag** at the Milano Cortina Opening Ceremony.

Before skiing, he was a **French national swimming champion** (100m backstroke) at 15. He also competed in football and judo. He now mentors three young Nigerian skiers living abroad.

> *"Representing a country rich in culture and diversity is a responsibility I cherish. It's a way to honour my ancestors and inspire future generations."*

**COMMENTARY NOTE:** When Ikpefan appears on the start line, the entire African continent has a reason to watch cross-country skiing.

### Stevenson Savart (Haiti) — The Cool Runnings of Cross-Country Skiing
**Age:** 25 | **Born:** Delmas, Haiti; raised in the Vosges, France (adopted by French parents)

Already a viral sensation after his **skiathlon finish on Feb 8** (64th, to crowd cheers). Savart grew up as the **only Black person skiing** in his area of the Vosges mountains.

> *"People stare at you, really insistently, and it can be unsettling."*

When people compared him to Cool Runnings and laughed, he responded: *"But once they see you can go fast on skis like they can, they come and speak to you more naturally."*

**Haiti's uniforms** are the talk of the Games — hand-painted by Italian-Haitian designer **Stella Jean**, featuring a riderless red horse against a tropical sky-blue background, inspired by artist Edouard Duval-Carrié. They originally featured revolutionary leader **Toussaint Louverture** on the horse, but the IOC required his removal.

> *"It's an immense source of pride and great happiness to wear this outfit… we're trying to be symbols for our small country, and give them hope, because right now they are going through a rather dark period."*

**COMMENTARY NOTE:** If Savart starts the sprint, his finish could be the most-shared moment of the day across social media.

### Matt Smith (South Africa) — Zero to Olympian in 3 Years
**Age:** 35 | **Born:** South Africa; now lives in Oslo, Norway

A **tech founder** who dreamed up a plan in 2022 to go from **complete novice to Olympic cross-country skier in 3 years**. Moved from South Africa to Oslo. Qualified at the 2025 World Championships despite **falling during the race and chipping his ski edge** — he borrowed a pole from a stranger and finished 38th.

He **carried the South African flag** at the Opening Ceremony.

Works with a sports psychologist after catching himself telling himself he was *"a joke"* and *"an embarrassment"* during races. When established Nordic skiers criticized the quota system on a podcast, saying FIS set the bar too low for "exotic" nations, Smith went on Instagram to confront them directly.

> Launched a weekly "Countdown to Cortina" podcast to give other underdog athletes a platform.

## TIER 2: THE POWERFUL ORIGIN STORIES

### Fredrik Fodstad (Colombia) — Born in Bogotá, Adopted by Norwegians
**Age:** 25 | **Born:** Bogotá, Colombia; raised in Norway

**Colombia's sole representative** at these Games. Born in Bogotá, adopted almost at birth by Norwegian parents Bente and Ole Torbjørn Fodstad. He knows almost nothing about his biological family. The idea to represent Colombia came from a **classmate's casual comment** — which became an Olympic journey.

Featured in the documentary *"The Wrong Track"* (2025). Colombia's delegation wore brightly patterned jackets at the Opening Ceremony.

Goal: Top 50. Colombia's government cut sports budgets in 2025, making his journey even harder.

### Attila Mihály Kertész (Israel) — A Vet, A Dream, One Pair of Skis
**Age:** 37 | **Born:** Hungary; lives in Thailand; races for Israel

Israel's **first-ever Olympic cross-country skier**. A Hungarian-born **veterinarian** who married a Jewish woman, obtained Israeli citizenship (a process interrupted by COVID, the Ukraine invasion, and the October 7 attack), and **self-funded his entire Olympic pursuit at a cost of ~$140,000**.

He owns **ONE pair of professional racing skis**. Top athletes typically carry 40-60 pairs for different snow conditions. He only picked up XC skiing in 2018 **at age 30**.

> *"It's never too late if you have the motivation."*

### Samer Tawk (Lebanon) — From Khalil Gibran's Village to the Olympics
**Age:** 27 | **Born:** Bcharri, Lebanon — the village of poet **Khalil Gibran**, overlooking the Valley of Saints

**First Lebanese XC skier ever** to qualify for the Olympics. Started alpine skiing at age 7. On April 26, 2019, suffered a near career-ending fall with **multiple fractures** to arms and legs. Seven years later, he still **can't fully feel his left leg** in cold weather, can't put too much pressure on his hand, or fully bend his elbow.

Initially considered the Paralympics. Then: *"I'm a stubborn person, so I told myself: Why not aim for the Olympics?"*

> *"It makes me forget the pain."*

Lebanon has competed at every Winter Olympics since 1948.

**Age:** 46 | **Born:** Guayaquil, Ecuador

Fell in love with XC skiing while studying in Norway. Has a **PhD in exercise physiology**. In 2016, he approached Ecuador's NOC and essentially **created the country's ski federation himself**. He simultaneously serves as **federation president, coach, AND athlete**.

Used to roller-ski on **Guayaquil highways at 4-5 AM** because normal roads were too uneven. Was Ecuador's **first Winter Olympian** and flag bearer at PyeongChang 2018.

## TIER 3: NATIONS WITH LEGITIMATE SPRINT CREDENTIALS

### Wang Qiang (China) — 1.4 Billion People's Sprint Hope
**Age:** ~32 | **Third Olympics** (2018, 2022, 2026)

The embodiment of China's **365-million-person winter sports revolution**. In March 2022, he finished **2nd in a World Cup sprint in Drammen, Norway** — the first Chinese cross-country skier to reach a World Cup podium, ever.

A country with 1.4 billion people that had essentially no competitive XC tradition produced a World Cup sprint silver medalist. That's the story.

### Mark Chanloung (Thailand) — A Homecoming
**Age:** 31 | **Born:** Gressoney-La-Trinité, Aosta Valley, Italy (Italian mother, Thai father) | **Third Olympics**

The Chanloung siblings (Mark and sister Karen) were born in Gressoney — the same tiny Walser village as Federico Pellegrino. Their father Boonchan, a Thai massage therapist who once **cycled 15,000km around Thailand in 126 days**, encouraged them to switch nationality from Italy to Thailand in 2016.

They've organized annual roller-skiing events in Thailand, growing participation from 40 to 265 athletes in 7 years. Thai youth athletes won a historic silver at the 2024 Gangwon Winter Youth Olympics.

**The homecoming angle:** The XC races are in Tesero/Val di Fiemme — **near where they grew up**. Their grandmother Ada will be watching in person.

### Andrew Musgrave (Great Britain) — The Five-Time Olympian Who Lives in Norway
**Age:** 35 | **Born:** England's south coast; raised in Aberdeenshire, Scotland; lives in Norway

His **fifth Olympics** — making him one of only a handful of British athletes across all sports to compete at five Winter Games. His family moved to Alaska when he was 5 (first learned skiing), then Aberdeenshire at 11, then Norway at 12. He's lived in Norway for **23 years** but remains "British at heart."

**10th in the Skiathlon** (Feb 8) — just 49.5 seconds behind Klæbo's gold. Collapsed at the finish.

> *"The Norwegians have been super, super good, taking us under their wing. They're the dominant nation in the sport, but they're also really keen on trying to get more nations involved."*

Teammate **James Clugnet** is a Frenchman racing for Britain because **France wouldn't have him** — and he became better than many French skiers as a result. Teammate **Joe Davies** is a Canadian who watched the 2010 Vancouver Olympics from the stands as a 9-year-old, 30 miles from home — and is now a 16th-place Olympic finisher himself.

### Lars Young Vik (Australia) — Olympic Pedigree from the Southern Hemisphere
**Age:** 25 | **Born:** Oslo, Norway (Norwegian father, Australian mother)

His uncle is **Bjarte Engen Vik** — 4 Olympic medals (2 gold) and 8 World Championship medals for Norway in Nordic combined. Lars started skiing at 2 in Norway.

Career-best: 33rd in sprint freestyle at 2025 Worlds (missed top-30 by **0.21 seconds**). Missed World Cup quarterfinals by **0.02 seconds**.

Australia sent its **largest-ever XC cohort** (8 athletes). Teammate **Maddie Hooker** (21, from Melbourne) entered the Olympic skiathlon having **never raced a skiathlon before in her life** — her parents scrambled to find her the specialized boots.

### Stanzin Lundup (India) — A Soldier from the Roof of the World
**Age:** 29 | **From:** Ladakh — one of the highest inhabited regions on Earth

An **Indian Army soldier** who qualified through the World Championships. His selection was **challenged in Delhi High Court** by a rival skier, creating controversy. Only 16 Indian athletes have ever competed at any Winter Olympics across 62 years. India has **never won a Winter Olympic medal**.

## THE BIGGER PICTURE: What These Stories Mean

### The Globalization of Cross-Country Skiing

| Continent | Athletes in Today's Sprint | Notable |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------|
| **Europe** | ~45-50 | Traditional powers + Italy, France, Germany, GB, Estonia, etc. |
| **North America** | ~7-8 | USA (3), Canada (1+), possibly Mexico |
| **Asia** | ~5-6 | China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Thailand, India, possibly Korea |
| **South America** | 1-2 | Colombia, possibly Ecuador |
| **Africa** | 1-2 | Nigeria (confirmed), possibly Morocco |
| **Oceania** | 1-2 | Australia |
| **Caribbean** | 0-1 | Haiti (possibly) |

### The Historical Arc — Philip Boit to Samuel Ikpefan

At the **1998 Nagano Olympics**, Kenyan XC skier **Philip Boit** finished last in the 10km classic. Norwegian legend **Bjørn Dæhlie**, who won gold, personally **waited at the finish line** to congratulate Boit — one of the most iconic moments in Olympic history, seen around the world.

Twenty-eight years later, Samuel Ikpefan doesn't just finish — he **competes**. Wang Qiang doesn't just participate — he reaches **World Cup podiums**. Andrew Musgrave doesn't just show up — he finishes **10th at the Olympics**.

The gap is closing. Cross-country skiing is no longer Scandinavia's private domain.

### The Quote That Captures It All
