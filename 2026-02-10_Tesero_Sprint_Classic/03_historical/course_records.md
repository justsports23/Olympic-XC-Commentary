# Course Records: Sprint at Tesero / Val di Fiemme

## Important Context: New Course for 2026

The sprint course for the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics is a **brand-new course** that was first used in competition during the Tour de Ski Stage 5 on January 3, 2026. The course measures **1,585 metres** -- notably longer than the typical 1.4-1.5 km sprint courses used at most World Cup venues.

Because the course is new, there is **extremely limited historical time data**. Previous sprint races at this venue (2003 World Championships, 2013 World Championships, and earlier Tour de Ski stages) were contested on different course layouts.

## Notes on Data Availability

- Comprehensive course record data for the new 2026 Olympic sprint course does not exist, as only one competitive event has been held on it (January 2026 Tour de Ski).
- The FIS homologation documents for the new course, which would contain official elevation profiles, total climb data, and course maps, were not publicly available in the search results at time of writing.
- Historical sprint times from the 2003 and 2013 World Championships at Val di Fiemme were contested on different course layouts and are not directly comparable to the 2026 Olympic sprint course.
- The January 2026 Tour de Ski sprint provides the only benchmark times, but snow and weather conditions will differ significantly from the February 2026 Olympic race window.
