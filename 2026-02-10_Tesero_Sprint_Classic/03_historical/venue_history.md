# Venue History: Tesero / Val di Fiemme, Italy

## Overview

The Cross Country and Biathlon Center Fabio Canal (formerly Lago di Tesero Cross-Country Stadium) is located in the municipality of Tesero in the Fiemme Valley (Val di Fiemme), Trentino, northern Italy, at approximately 830-850 metres above sea level. It is one of the most storied cross-country skiing venues in the world, having hosted over 400 international races. With the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, Val di Fiemme becomes the only location in the Nordic skiing circuit to have hosted all major event types: Olympics, Paralympics, World Championships, World Cup, Tour de Ski, and Universiade.

The venue's legacy traces to the legendary gold medal of Franco Nones (from Castello di Fiemme) in the 30 km event at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble -- the first non-Scandinavian/non-Soviet gold in cross-country skiing. This result inspired the creation of the Marcialonga in 1971 and planted the seed for Val di Fiemme's future as a Nordic skiing hub.

## FIS Nordic World Ski Championships

Val di Fiemme is one of only a handful of venues to host the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships three times.

### 1991 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships (7-17 February 1991)

The first FIS Nordic World Ski Championships held south of the Alps. The venue at Lago di Tesero was purpose-built for this event after the FIS awarded the championships to Val di Fiemme at the 1988 Istanbul convention.

The Tour traditionally concludes with two or three stages in Val di Fiemme, culminating in the famous "Final Climb" up Alpe Cermis in Cavalese -- a 9.0 km course featuring a 3.6 km climb with an average gradient of 11.6% and a maximum gradient of 28.0%, nicknamed "Monster Bakken" by the Norwegians.
