## Weather Forecast (Tesero, Val di Fiemme)
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Air Temperature (Qualification ~09:55)** | Estimated -5°C to -8°C |
| **Air Temperature (Finals ~13:25)** | Estimated near 0°C |
| **Snow Temperature** | [Exact data race-morning — estimated -8°C morning, near 0°C afternoon] |
| **Humidity** | High (artificial snow crystals + valley location) |
| **Wind** | [DATA NOT FOUND — check race-day reports] |
| **Precipitation** | [DATA NOT FOUND] |
| **Sky Conditions** | [DATA NOT FOUND] |

> **Note:** The temperature swing from a likely **-5 to -8°C at qualification** to near **0°C for the final** is the critical waxing challenge. Weather data will be confirmed on race morning from official FIS weather reports.

## General February Climate — Tesero, Val di Fiemme
- **Typical air temperature range:** -5°C to +5°C
- **Typical snow temperature:** -8°C to -2°C
- **Elevation:** ~840m — moderate continental Alpine valley climate
- **Snow conditions:** February in Val di Fiemme typically features well-groomed, machine-made and natural snow bases; conditions can range from cold/dry to warming/transforming depending on weather patterns
- **Key factor:** Morning qualification will see cold, fast conditions; afternoon finals will see softer, potentially slower and more variable snow

## Wax Considerations for Classic Sprint

### The Critical Challenge: Temperature Swing
The potential **10°C temperature swing** from qualification to final is the defining wax challenge of this race. Service teams may need to **adjust grip wax between rounds**. This is a massive logistical challenge during the short intervals between quarterfinals, semifinals, and final.

### Grip Wax
- Classic technique requires **kick wax or klister** applied to the grip zone under the foot
- **Morning qualification (-5°C to -8°C):** Hard wax territory (e.g., Swix V40, V30)
- **Afternoon heats (near 0°C):** Medium-to-warm waxes (e.g., Swix V45, V55) or potentially covered klister
- Grip wax choice is **race-critical in sprint** — too much grip slows glide; too little causes slip on the demanding 23m main climb
- The 49m total climbing on this course means grip wax failure is more punishing here than on typical sprint courses

### Glide Wax
- Fluorocarbon wax ban (since 2023-24 season) remains in effect for 2025-26
- Teams use hydrocarbon and non-fluorinated high-performance glide waxes
- **Glide speed on descents proved decisive** at the January Tour de Ski test event on this course
- Ski speed is a significant factor in qualification (individual time trial) and creates separation on descents in heats
- Artificial snow crystals and high humidity complicate glide wax selection

### Wax Team Advantages
- **Norway** — historically one of the strongest wax teams; deep resources via Fischer/Swix/Rex; vast experience at Val di Fiemme from Tour de Ski
- **Italy** — **home advantage** in understanding local snow conditions; intimate familiarity with Tesero's artificial snow characteristics
- **Sweden** — strong wax preparation; partnership with major wax brands (Rossignol, etc.)
- **Finland** — historically strong wax expertise
- **Fischer, Rossignol, and Madshus technicians** have all raced this venue extensively and have specific course knowledge

### Ski Brand Distribution (Key Athletes)
| Brand | Athletes |
|---|---|
| **Fischer** | Klæbo, Valnes, Amundsen (NOR) |
| **Rossignol** | Pellegrino (ITA), Anger (SWE) |
| **Madshus** | Chappaz (FRA), Ogden (USA) |
| **Salomon** | Cyr (CAN) |

## Snow Conditions Notes
- The Tesero course uses a **mix of natural and machine-made snow**
- Artificial snow crystals behave differently from natural snow — more abrasive, different moisture characteristics
- February conditions in Val di Fiemme can change rapidly — morning events see firm, fast tracks that soften by afternoon
- **Qualification (09:55)** will likely see the coldest, fastest conditions
- **Finals (13:25)** will see warmer, softer, potentially slower conditions — track may deteriorate significantly with 80+ athletes having skied it
- Late starters in qualification may benefit or suffer from track deterioration depending on conditions
