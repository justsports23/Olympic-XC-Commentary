**Season Summary:** Valnes has been Norway's clear no. 2 sprinter behind Klaebo this season, with a sprint win chance at Ruka (finished 2nd) and consistent top-6 sprint finishes. His distance form has been solid when he is fresh (3rd at Oberhof 10km classic), but he struggled badly in the Tour de Ski multi-stage format and withdrew. His last pre-Olympic sprint in Goms ended with a crash in the semifinal. He enters the Olympics dealing with a cold.

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** **Elite** — Valnes is one of the world's best classic sprinters. His Ruka Sprint Classic wins (2020, 2023) and Oberhof/Cogne classic sprint victories demonstrate top-tier classic technique. His silver in the 10km classic at Trondheim Worlds 2025 shows he can compete over distance in classic as well. — [FIS Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=183139)
- **Freestyle strength:** **Strong but secondary** — Capable skate sprinter but less dominant than in classic. Eliminated in QF at Beijing 2022 individual sprint (free technique). Eliminated in SF at Davos 2025 sprint (free). Won team sprint free events (with Klaebo). — [Olympics.com](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/cross-country-skiing/athlete-profile-n1032204-erik-valnes.htm)
- **Sprint ability:** **World-class** — Consistently the 2nd-best sprinter in the world behind Klaebo over the past two seasons. Explosive final-straight speed and tactical awareness in heats. — [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2021-22/norways-sprint-wizard-erik-valnes-fis-cross-country-e_ngflrcjsq)
- **Distance preference:** Sprint specialist who has expanded into distance racing. Won a 20km mass start (Oberhof 2024) and a 15km mass start (TdS Val di Fiemme 2024). Podium in 10km classic (Oberhof 2026, Trondheim Worlds 2025). Not a stage-race or Tour de Ski contender. — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/erik-valnes-winner-at-the-world-cup-20km-mass-start-in-oberhof/)
- **Best format:** Sprint finals (classic preferred); team sprint (with Klaebo)
- **Climbing ability:** Good but not exceptional. Can handle moderate climbs; struggles on extreme climbs like Alpe Cermis. His sprint power translates to punchy climbs in sprint courses.
- **Race intelligence:** Very high. Known for positioning and tactical awareness in sprint heats and mass starts. — [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2021-22/norways-sprint-wizard-erik-valnes-fis-cross-country-e_ngflrcjsq)

**Olympic Sprint Classic Fit Assessment:** The classic sprint in Tesero suits Valnes well. Classic technique is his stronger discipline. Sprint is his best format. Val di Fiemme courses at moderate altitude (~1,000m) with rolling terrain should not disadvantage him. If healthy, Valnes is a strong medal contender.

**Venue Summary:** Valnes has limited but mixed history at Val di Fiemme/Tesero. His standout result was a dominant 15km mass start classic win in January 2024 at Tour de Ski, where he used his sprint finish to prevail. The course and venue are familiar to him from multiple Tour de Ski editions. The Olympic sprint course layout may differ from Tour de Ski distance courses, but Valnes knows the stadium and general terrain. Tesero sits at approximately 1,000m elevation. — [FiemmeWorldCup.com](https://www.fiemmeworldcup.com/en/Winter-Olympic-Games-2026/Cross-country-stadium)

## Key Storylines

### 1. Suffering from a Cold Entering the Olympic Sprint
Norway announced its classic sprint lineup on February 5, 2026, confirming that Erik Valnes was retained **despite suffering from a cold**. The Norwegian Ski Federation selected Klaebo, Oskar Opstad Vike, Harald Oestberg Amundsen, and Valnes for the men's classic sprint. The decision to keep Valnes signals confidence that he can recover sufficiently for the February 10 race, but his form and fitness are a genuine concern. — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-norway-announces-the-names-of-its-athletes-for-the-start-of-the-skiathlon-and-classic-sprint-events-0205/)

### 2. Tour de Ski Withdrawal and Fatigue Management
Valnes withdrew from the Tour de Ski in early January after describing his 20km classic pursuit in Toblach as "the worst skiing day of his life." The Norwegian Ski Association stated he "feels tired and has not recovered sufficiently." This withdrawal may have been strategically motivated — preserving energy for the Olympic sprint rather than grinding through remaining Tour stages. — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-tour-de-ski-erik-valnes-will-not-be-taking-part-in-the-last-two-stages-0102/)

### 3. Crash at Goms — Last Pre-Olympic Sprint
In the final World Cup sprint before the Olympics (Goms, January 24), Valnes was the 2nd-fastest qualifier but crashed in the semifinal after tangling skis with a competitor, finishing 11th overall. This means his last sprint race before the Olympic sprint ended in a fall — a potentially shaky confidence note heading into Tesero. — [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/01/schumacher-two-days-two-podiums/)

### 4. The Klaebo Partnership — Team Sprint Gold Favorites
Valnes and Klaebo have been the dominant team sprint pairing in the world for years: gold at 2021 Worlds (Oberstdorf), gold at 2022 Olympics (Beijing), gold at 2025 Worlds (Trondheim), and a Davos World Cup team sprint win this season. They are heavy favorites for team sprint gold at Milano Cortina 2026 as well. — [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-and-valnes-stay-out-of-trouble-to-win-davos-team-sprint)

### 5. The Eternal Second to Klaebo
Valnes' career narrative is inextricable from Klaebo. He is consistently the 2nd-best Norwegian sprinter and frequently the 2nd-best in the world. At the 2021 Worlds, he took individual sprint silver behind Klaebo. At the 2025 Worlds, silver in the 10km behind Klaebo. In the 2025-26 sprint standings, he sat 2nd behind Klaebo after Trondheim. The Olympic sprint represents another chance to either step out of Klaebo's shadow or finish on the podium alongside him.

### 6. Back Injury History
At the 2025 Trondheim World Championships, Valnes was forced to miss the skate sprint due to a back injury sustained during training. He has shown the ability to bounce back from setbacks, but his recent health issues (back + cold) are a pattern of concern entering the Games. — [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-with-a-back-injury-erik-valnes-will-not-be-at-the-start-of-the-skate-sprint-at-the-trondheim-world-championships-0226/)

### 7. Early Olympic Selection — Core of Norway's Sprint Plans
Valnes was among the eight athletes named early to Norway's Olympic team, reflecting his status as a central figure in their sprint ambitions at Milano Cortina 2026. — [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/01/the-cost-of-being-the-best-norway-finally-locks-in-its-olympic-squad/)
