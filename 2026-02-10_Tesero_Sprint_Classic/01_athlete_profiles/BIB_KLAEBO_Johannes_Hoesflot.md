## Technique & Format Profile

- **Classic strength:** Elite. Has won World Championship sprint titles in classic and dominated classic-technique distance races throughout 2025-26. Won the sprint classic at the 2025-26 Tour de Ski on the Olympic course in Val di Fiemme [(source)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/2025-26-tour-de-ski-sprint-classic-penultimate-stage-results/). His 2025 Trondheim Worlds 10km classic gold and his consistent classic sprint dominance confirm top-tier classic ability.
- **Freestyle strength:** Elite. Has won Olympic sprint gold in free technique (2022), World Championship sprint golds in free technique (2019, 2023, 2025), and many WC freestyle distance wins. The one notable weakness is the Alpe Cermis Final Climb in free technique, where he has historically lost time [(source)](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/stenshagen-wins-tour-de-ski-final-climb-klaebo-overall-winner/).
- **Sprint ability:** The greatest sprinter in XC skiing history. Holds the record for most World Cup sprint wins (~62+). Has won the sprint at 4 consecutive World Championships (2019-2025). Three-time Olympic sprint champion (2018 classic, 2022 free, 2026 TBD). His acceleration and finishing speed are unmatched [(source)](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-chases-olympic-history-at-milano-cortina-2026).
- **Distance preference:** Originally a pure sprinter, Klaebo has evolved into a complete all-rounder. Since 2024-25, he has been dominant across all distances from sprint to 50km. His 2025 Trondheim clean sweep (sprint through 50km) confirmed total mastery of every distance [(source)](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-sixth-gold-2025-worlds--mens-50km-mass-start).
- **Best format:** Excels in all formats. Particularly dominant in sprints and mass start races where his tactical awareness and finishing speed are decisive. Also extremely strong in skiathlon format, where he can use both techniques. Interval start distance races are perhaps his relatively weakest format, though still world-class.
- **Climbing ability:** Very strong but not his absolute strength relative to pure climbers. He lost significant time on the Alpe Cermis Final Climb (12th on stage) at the 2025-26 Tour de Ski but had built enough margin to win overall. On shorter climbs and undulating courses he is dominant [(source)](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/stenshagen-wins-tour-de-ski-final-climb-klaebo-overall-winner/).

**Sprint Classic Assessment for This Race:** Klaebo is the overwhelming favourite. He won the Tour de Ski sprint classic on this exact course in Val di Fiemme on 3 January 2026 (3:21.28), dominating every round. Classic sprint is his signature discipline — he has won the World Championship classic sprint in 2018, 2021, and multiple WC classic sprints this season (Ruka, Trondheim, Goms).

## Venue History — Tesero / Val di Fiemme

Val di Fiemme is a venue Klaebo knows extremely well from the Tour de Ski, which has concluded there annually with the Final Climb up Alpe Cermis.

**Key Takeaway:** Klaebo has raced on this specific Olympic sprint course (Val di Fiemme/Tesero) just five weeks before the Olympic sprint and won decisively. He has called Val di Fiemme a course where he "feels good" [(source)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-victorious-in-the-skiathlon-and-on-course-for-a-grand-slam-0208/).

## Key Storylines

### 1. The Grand Slam Quest
After sweeping all six gold medals at the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim, Klaebo is attempting to replicate that feat at the Olympic level. With the skiathlon gold already secured on 8 February, he is on course for a potential Olympic "grand slam" across all events he enters (sprint, 10km free, team sprint, relay). No athlete has ever won six golds at a single Winter Olympics — the record stands at five [(source)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-victorious-in-the-skiathlon-and-on-course-for-a-grand-slam-0208/).

### 2. Chasing Bjorn Dahlie's Record
Klaebo now has 6 Olympic golds. Bjorn Dahlie holds the all-time men's XC record with 8 Olympic golds (12 medals total). Two more golds at these Games would tie Dahlie. Klaebo has stated this is a career goal [(source)](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-chases-olympic-history-at-milano-cortina-2026).

### 3. Anxiety and Nerves
Despite his dominance, Klaebo has been open about battling pre-competition anxiety at these Olympics. He reported "a very high resting heart rate" and being "very nervous" in the days before the skiathlon. He credited his experience from two prior Olympics with helping manage the pressure [(source)](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/a-familiar-king-klaebo-opens-milano-cortina-with-skiathlon-gold/).

### 4. Sprint Rivals
- **Federico Pellegrino (ITA):** Flag bearer for Italy at the opening ceremony, competing in his fourth and final Olympics. Won two consecutive Olympic sprint silvers behind Klaebo. Will have home crowd support in Tesero [(source)](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-chases-olympic-history-at-milano-cortina-2026).
- **Edvin Anger (SWE):** Young Swedish talent, finished 2nd overall in 2024-25 WC standings but has underperformed in sprints this season [(source)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/cross-country-skiing-johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-challengers-youth-olympic-champions-norwegian-compatriots/).
- **Erik Valnes (NOR):** Klaebo's team sprint partner and fellow sprint specialist, with 20+ WC podiums and two world titles [(source)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/cross-country-skiing-world-cup-2025-26-season-preview-olympic-qualification-format-schedule-live).
- **Lars Heggen (NOR):** 20-year-old who won the Oberhof sprint in Klaebo's absence — a rising talent [(source)](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skier-lars-heggen-wins-first-world-cup-oberhof-sprint).

### 5. Most Dominant Season Ever
The 2025-26 season represents arguably the most dominant campaign in XC skiing history. Klaebo leads all three WC standings, won a record 5th Tour de Ski, reached his 100th career WC win in Trondheim, and has won the vast majority of his race starts [(source)](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/cross-country-world-cup-2025-2026-standings-after-goms/).

### 6. Family Legacy
Klaebo's 83-year-old grandfather Kare Hosflot remains his personal coach and has been with him since gifting him his first pair of skis at age two. His father Haakon serves as his manager. This family unit has been central to his success story [(source)](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/cross-country-grandfather-effect-how-82-year-old-coach-kare-hosflot-built-norway-star-johannes-klaebo).
