## Personal Life & Commentary Notes

### Hometown & Family
- From **Andebu** in Sandefjord, Vestfold — a coastal region known for whaling history, not for producing skiers. Club: **IL Runar**.
- **Brother: Lars Opstad Vike** — also a competitive XC skier. In 2020, the brothers each won their age class at the Lauritz Bergendahl Memorial Race. [Tønsberg Blad](https://www.tb.no/brodrene-oskar-og-lars-til-topps-i-hver-sin-klasse/s/5-76-1214220)
- **Girlfriend: Anniken Sand** — he was in the car with her when he got the national team call-up: *"I was sitting in the car with my girlfriend Anniken when Arild Monsen called."* [Langrenn.com](https://www.langrenn.com/langrenn-allround/vike-noen-ma-sla-klaebo-snart/)

### Back Injury Timeline
- **Aug 2025:** Stress fracture in the **sacrum** during training. Couldn't walk the next morning. 3-4 weeks zero training.
- **Dec 2025 comeback:** 2nd behind Klæbo at Trondheim (+0.31s) — career best.
- **Jan 1, 2026:** Back pain returned during Tour de Ski — withdrew. Still selected for Olympics.

### Unconventional Path
- Came through **Team Ragde Charge** (marathon skiing team) before elevation to the national sprint squad — unusual route.
- Also competed in **track and field** as a youth.
- *"It took one season at the senior level. That's perhaps not quite normal."* [Langrenn.com](https://www.langrenn.com/langrenn-allround/vike-noen-ma-sla-klaebo-snart/)

### On Beating Klæbo
- *"Someone has to beat Klæbo soon. It's a big goal, and anything is possible."*

### Top 3 Commentary Sound Bites
1. From Vestfold on Norway's coast — not the mountains — he took the marathon skiing route to become a world-class sprinter
2. Stress fracture in his sacrum, couldn't walk — 4 months later he finished 2nd behind Klæbo
3. "Someone has to beat Klæbo soon" — the 22-year-old who genuinely believes he can do it
