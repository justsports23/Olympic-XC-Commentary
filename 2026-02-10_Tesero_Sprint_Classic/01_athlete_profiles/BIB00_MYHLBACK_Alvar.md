**Bib:** TBD | **FIS Code:** [DATA NOT FOUND] | **DOB:** ~2006 | **Age:** 19
**Club/Team:** [DATA NOT FOUND] | **National Team Tier:** Olympic team (Sweden)

- FIS Sprint Points: ~166 (after Trondheim)

## Season Form (2025-26)
| Date | Event | Location | Discipline | Format | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Dec 5 | World Cup | Trondheim, NOR | Sprint Classic | Heats | **3rd** | WC sprint podium at age 19 |

## Career Highlights
- **Won Vasaloppet** — the legendary 90km marathon. At just 19 years old, this is an extraordinary endurance achievement.
- **WC sprint podium at Trondheim** (3rd in classic sprint) — translating marathon endurance to sprint podium
- The field's most improbable storyline — from 90km marathon champion to WC sprint podium
- Selected for Swedish Olympic team in December 2025

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Excellent — podium at WC classic sprint, Vasaloppet winner
- **Sprint ability:** Emerging — WC podium at Trondheim proves he can compete at the highest level
- **Distance preference:** Endurance — his Vasaloppet win shows extraordinary stamina
- **Climbing ability:** **Exceptional.** His marathon endurance is an unconventional asset on this long, climbing course. The 1,585m course with 49m climbing may play to his strength more than a typical flat sprint.
- **Key insight:** His endurance translated to a classic sprint podium at age 19 — on a climbing course like Tesero, this profile could be dangerous

## Key Storylines
- The most improbable storyline in the field — 19-year-old Vasaloppet 90km marathon champion earning WC sprint podiums
- His marathon endurance on this long, climbing course could be a unique advantage
- Olympic debut — if he can handle the pressure, a quarterfinal breakout is plausible
- At 19, he is the youngest athlete with serious sprint credentials in the field
