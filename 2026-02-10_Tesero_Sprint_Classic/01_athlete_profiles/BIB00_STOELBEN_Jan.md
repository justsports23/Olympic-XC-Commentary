## Personal Life & Commentary Notes

### The Incredible Underdog Story
- **Full name:** Jan Stoelben. Born **June 15, 2001** in **Manderscheid, Vulkaneifel**, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Son of two doctors.
- **Originally a tennis player.** Discovered XC skiing in **2013 at age 12** through a school sports competition. *"I was basically jogging on skis."* [LSB Rheinland-Pfalz](https://www.lsb-rlp.de/fachverbandsnews/2023/jan-stoelben-aus-der-eifel-hoch-hinaus-im-wintersport)

### Training Alone in Snow-Scarce Germany
- Trained **mostly alone on roller skis** on a cycling path through former railway tunnels in the Eifel volcanic region.
- **Rejected from elite academy in Oberhof** — technique too poor from solo roller-ski training.
- During **COVID lockdown**: did pull-ups under the dining table and ran **100 laps in his parents' garden**. *"It's quite tough mentally when you run 100 laps in the garden."* Groomed his own training tracks **with a quad bike**.

- **Bought a cabin near Lillehammer** to get on snow — Germany's Eifel simply doesn't have enough.

### Historic First
- **First XC skier from Rhineland-Palatinate** to make the German national squad.
- Four-time German Sprint Champion (2022-2025).
- Best WC result: **6th in sprint** on this Olympic course at Tour de Ski — securing his Olympic spot.
- *"That I can show my ability there is definitely not utopia. That is very, very realistic."*
