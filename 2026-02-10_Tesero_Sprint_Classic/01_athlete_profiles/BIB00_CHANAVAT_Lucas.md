## Season Form (2025-26)
| Date | Event | Location | Discipline | Format | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Dec 13 | World Cup | Davos, SUI | Sprint Free | Heats | **1st** | Won over Pellegrino by 0.03s |
| Various | World Cup | Various | Sprint Classic | Qual | 27th, 40th, 44th | **Classic sprint results have been dire** |

## Career Highlights
- **Won Davos freestyle sprint** (Dec 2025) — beating Pellegrino by the narrowest of margins
- Multiple World Cup sprint podiums across career
- Veteran French sprint specialist
- Historically strong in freestyle but classic sprint is his weaker technique

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** **Weak this season.** 27th, 40th, 44th in classic sprint qualifications — his greatest liability for an Olympic classic event.
- **Freestyle strength:** **Elite.** Won Davos WC freestyle sprint.
- **Sprint ability:** World-class in freestyle; inconsistent in classic.
- **Key issue:** The Olympic sprint being classic technique **effectively neutralizes his greatest weapon.** His classic sprint qualification results this season (27th, 40th, 44th) suggest he may struggle to even make the top 30.

## Key Storylines
- The classic technique requirement is a devastating format mismatch for Chanavat
- His Davos freestyle win shows his speed is elite — but that speed doesn't translate to classic
- May play more of a team sprint role for France rather than a realistic individual medal contender here

## Personal Life & Commentary Notes

### Hometown
- Born **December 17, 1994** in **Le Grand-Bornand**, Haute-Savoie — one of France's most famous ski towns, host to World Cup biathlon events and 1999 Nordic World Championships.

### Personality & Interests
- Childhood dream: wanted to be an **astronaut**. [UNVERIFIED — from French media]
- Background in **judo** before focusing on skiing.
- Fan of **Muhammad Ali** — draws inspiration from Ali's mental toughness and self-belief.
- Co-hosts a podcast about French sprint skiing.

### Comeback from Stress Fracture
- Overcame a **stress fracture** earlier in his career that threatened his Olympic dreams.
- 5 World Cup wins across career, but no major championship individual medal — 5th and 6th in finals. The classic technique requirement today makes a medal unlikely given his 27th, 40th, 44th qualifications in classic this season.

### Top 2 Commentary Sound Bites
1. Childhood dream was to be an astronaut — he'll need to launch today to make this classic sprint work as a freestyle specialist
2. 5 World Cup wins but zero championship medals — the classic format may be his greatest obstacle
