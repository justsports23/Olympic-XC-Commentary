## Season Form (2025-26)

### Sprint Results
| Date | Event | Location | Discipline | Format | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Nov 29 | World Cup | Ruka, FIN | Sprint Classic | Qual | DNQ | Failed to qualify for heats |
| Dec 13 | World Cup | Davos, SUI | Sprint Free | Heats | **2nd** | Lost to Chanavat by 0.03s |
| Dec/Jan | World Cup | Oberhof, GER | Sprint Free | Heats | **2nd** | |

| Jan 24 | World Cup | Goms, SUI | Sprint Classic | Heats | [DATA NOT FOUND] | |

**Season assessment:** Inconsistent. Strong in freestyle sprints (2nd at Davos, 2nd at Oberhof) but **classic sprint form is a concern** — failed to qualify at Ruka, qualified only 25th on this Olympic course in January, eliminated in semifinals. The Olympic event being classic format is a headwind for his 2025-26 form.

## Career Highlights
- **Olympic medals: 2 silver** — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Pellegrino)
  - PyeongChang 2018: Silver (Sprint Classic) — behind Klæbo
  - Beijing 2022: Silver (Sprint Free) — behind Klæbo
- **World Championship medals: 7 (1 gold)**
  - 2017 Lahti: Gold (Sprint Free) — his crowning achievement
  - 2025 Trondheim: Silver (Sprint) — behind Klæbo
  - Multiple team sprint medals
- **World Cup wins: 17–18** (all sprints)
- **Sprint World Cup globe winner** (multiple seasons)
- Carried Italy's flag at Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony (San Siro)

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Good but secondary to freestyle. His classic sprint has been weaker this season (DNQ at Ruka, 25th qual at Val di Fiemme).
- **Freestyle strength:** **Elite.** His freestyle sprint is world-class — 2nd at Davos and Oberhof this season.
- **Sprint ability:** **World-class** — 17-18 WC sprint victories, but exclusively a sprinter (not competitive in distance events).
- **Distance preference:** Sprint only — his career is built entirely on sprint events.
- **Best format:** Sprint heats — his **tactical brilliance and positioning** through tight corners is unmatched. His ability to read races and make decisive moves is his greatest weapon.
- **Climbing ability:** Good but declining at age 35. The long Olympic climb may expose age-related power limitations against younger legs.

## Venue History (Tesero / Val di Fiemme)
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-------|
| Jan 3, 2026 | Tour de Ski | Sprint Classic | ~10th | Qualified 25th, eliminated in SF |
| Multiple years | Tour de Ski / WC | Sprint | Various | Extensive venue history |

## Key Storylines
- **Farewell Games:** Has announced this will be his **final season**. Racing the last individual event of a career that transformed Italian cross-country skiing.
- **Potential historic silver:** Could become the **first athlete in any sport to win silver in the same individual winter event at three consecutive Games** (2018, 2022, 2026 — all behind Klæbo).
- **Home crowd:** Racing on Italian snow in his final Games. Expect a vocal Italian crowd creating a football-stadium atmosphere on the climb.
- **Father of two** — son Fabien born April 2025
- **Carried Italy's flag** at the opening ceremony — enormous emotional weight
- **Classic technique concern:** His classic sprint form this season is weaker than his freestyle sprint — a worry given the Olympic event is classic.
- Quote: "In every race, I'll give my best to find a way to move tactically, with the body, with the mind"

## Personal Life & Commentary Notes

### Family & Gressoney Heritage
- From **Gressoney-La-Trinité** (pop. ~300), a **Walser community** in the Lys Valley of Aosta Valley — a German-speaking Alpine settlement unique in Italy, below Monte Rosa (4,634m).
- **Father** inspired by **1994 Lillehammer Olympics** — put young Federico on skis as a toddler. **32 years later**, the son carries Italy's flag at 2026. A full-circle narrative.
- Has an older brother and younger brother (names not publicly reported).
- **Son: Fabien** — born **April 2025**. Becoming a father during his farewell season adds profound emotional weight.

### Flag Bearer & Farewell Season
- **Carried Italy's flag** at Milano Cortina 2026 Opening Ceremony at San Siro. [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/federico-pellegrino-exclusive-milano-cortina-2026-cross-country-skiing)
- **Final competitive season.** The sprint is the last major individual race of his career.
- After a disappointing skiathlon: *"I'm going to give it my all"* for the sprint.

### Fiamme Oro — For International Viewers
- Races for **Fiamme Oro** ("Golden Flames"), elite sports division of the **Italian State Police**. Athletes get a police officer's salary while training full-time — the Italian way of funding Olympic athletes.

### The Klæbo Rivalry
- Lost **two Olympic sprint silvers to Klæbo** (2018, 2022). Could become the **first athlete ever to win silver in the same individual winter event at three consecutive Games**.
