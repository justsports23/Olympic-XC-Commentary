**Season Summary:** Top-8 in World Cup sprint standings. One individual podium (3rd, Oberhof freestyle sprint). Best results in freestyle sprint format, but has also shown competence in classic sprint (6th at Ruka). Withdrew from Tour de Ski to manage workload ahead of Olympics. His Oberhof podium came in a field missing Klaebo, but he defeated Pellegrino in the semifinal — a significant scalp. Strong form entering the Olympics.

| # | Date | Location | Discipline | Result |
|---|------|----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Mar 15, 2024 | Falun (SWE) | Sprint Classic | **2nd** (+1.14s behind Klaebo) — First career individual WC podium. "I've been in the World Cup for many years and made it to a couple of finals, but I've never made it onto the podium so that feels great." [FIS — Klaebo wins Falun sprint](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/klaebo-signs-off-one-of-the-best-sprint-seasons-of-his-career-with-falun-victory) |

- **Lahti, Mar 1, 2024:** 3rd — Team sprint classic with Iivo Niskanen. First career WC team sprint podium. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauri_Vuorinen)

---

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Strong — 2 of his 3 individual WC podiums came in classic sprint (Falun 2024, Ruka 2024). His 2025 Worlds bronze was in freestyle, showing versatility, but classic is historically his stronger technique. Finished 6th in Ruka classic sprint this season. [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/klaebo-signs-off-one-of-the-best-sprint-seasons-of-his-career-with-falun-victory)
- **Freestyle strength:** Capable — 3rd at Oberhof freestyle sprint, 2025 Worlds sprint bronze was in freestyle. Can compete at the top in both techniques. [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/-lucky-lars-heggen-20-sprints-to-first-world-cup-in-oberhof)
- **Sprint ability:** Elite specialist. Sprint is his primary discipline; he rarely competes in distance events. His FIS sprint points (25.49, rank #13) are far superior to his distance points (46.81, rank #132). [FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=176533)
- **Distance preference:** Pure sprinter. Competes almost exclusively in sprint and team sprint events.
- **Best format:** Individual sprint — particularly classic sprint on hilly courses where his power is an asset.
- **Climbing ability:** Good for a sprinter. At Ruka 2024, he passed Northug on the final climb to take 3rd. Able to generate power on uphills. [Ruka Nordic](https://rukanordic.com/en/klaebo-dominates-ruka-sprint-and-vuorinen-claims-podium/)
- **Tactical racing:** Smart and experienced heat racer. At the 2025 Worlds, he navigated from 9th qualifier through to the final by winning his semifinal convincingly and avoiding crashes by choosing the outside line in his QF. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/02/klaebo-thrills-hometown-crowd-with-world-sprint-title/)
- **Physical profile:** 172 cm, 72 kg — compact and powerful build well-suited to classic sprint. [FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=176533)

## Venue History (Tesero / Val di Fiemme)

| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-------|
| Jan 2025 | Tour de Ski 2024-25 | Various | **Overall TdS result: +3:55.7** | Competed in the Val di Fiemme stages of the 2024-25 Tour de Ski. [FIS Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=CC&raceid=46785) |
| Dec 28, 2025 | Tour de Ski 2025-26 | Sprint Freestyle (Toblach) | **31st** (DNQ) | Started the 2025-26 Tour de Ski but withdrew before the Val di Fiemme stages. Did NOT race the Val di Fiemme sprint classic on Jan 3, 2026. [Nordic Insights](https://nordicinsights.news/2026/01/02/viewing-guide-for-december-28-january-1-tour-de-ski-part-i-toblach/) |

**Key takeaway:** Vuorinen has limited recent experience on the exact Olympic sprint course at Tesero. He withdrew from the 2025-26 Tour de Ski before the Val di Fiemme sprint classic stage (Jan 3), so he did not preview the Olympic course this season. He has raced at Val di Fiemme in previous Tour de Ski editions but his venue-specific sprint data is limited. He reportedly commented that he skied the sprint course "once before — last year — and that time it was terrible." [Yle](https://yle.fi/)

## Key Storylines

- **World Championship breakthrough:** Vuorinen's individual sprint bronze at the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim was the first World Championship sprint medal ever won by a Finnish man. Paired with team sprint silver, it established him as a genuine championship performer capable of delivering on the biggest stages. This gives him enormous confidence heading into his first Olympic medal opportunity. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/02/klaebo-thrills-hometown-crowd-with-world-sprint-title/)

- **Third Olympics — final shot?** This is Vuorinen's third Olympic Games (after Pyeongchang 2018 and Beijing 2022) and could be his last. At 31, he has publicly expressed uncertainty about continuing after Milano Cortina: "Vuorinen, who claimed silver in the team sprint and bronze in the individual sprint at the World Championships in Trondheim, is unsure whether he will continue after the Milano-Cortina 2026 Olympics." [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/half-the-national-team-considering-retirement/)

- **Consistent top-10 sprint racer:** Now in his third consecutive season as a top-10 World Cup sprint performer. His FIS sprint ranking of #13 and WC sprint standing of 8th confirm he is a tier-two sprinter — behind the elite tier (Klaebo, Pellegrino, Chanavat) but firmly capable of podiums when things go right. [FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=176533)

- **Smart Tour de Ski withdrawal:** Withdrew from the Tour de Ski before the Val di Fiemme stages to manage his body for the Olympics. This was a strategic decision — preserving energy for the Games rather than grinding through a multi-stage tour. It means he arrives at the Olympics fresher than athletes who completed the full Tour. [Nordic Insights](https://nordicinsights.news/2026/01/02/viewing-guide-for-december-28-january-1-tour-de-ski-part-i-toblach/)

- **Classic sprint is favorable for him:** Two of his three career individual WC podiums came in classic sprint. The Olympic sprint format (classic technique) plays to his historically stronger technique. His only freestyle podium was Oberhof 2026, where the field was weakened by Klaebo's absence. [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/klaebo-signs-off-one-of-the-best-sprint-seasons-of-his-career-with-falun-victory)

- **Partner is Johanna Matintalo:** His partner is Finnish cross-country skier Johanna Matintalo, who is also competing at these Olympics. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauri_Vuorinen)

- **Late bloomer:** Vuorinen did not earn his first individual WC podium until age 29 (Falun 2024). His career trajectory has been one of steady improvement rather than early dominance, reaching his peak in his late 20s/early 30s.
