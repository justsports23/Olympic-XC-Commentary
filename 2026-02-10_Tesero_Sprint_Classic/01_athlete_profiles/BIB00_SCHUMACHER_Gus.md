## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Strong — 2nd at Goms classic sprint behind Klæbo
- **Freestyle strength:** Strong — competitive across both techniques
- **Sprint ability:** **Rising.** Not traditionally a sprint specialist (primarily distance-focused) but posted 2nd at Goms sprint — his endurance translates to sprint ability on long, climbing courses.
- **Distance preference:** **Distance specialist** who has shown surprising sprint ability this season, especially on demanding courses
- **Climbing ability:** **Excellent.** His self-assessment of the course ("it favors a guy like me—capacity") indicates he views the climb as an advantage

- The pile-up in the skiathlon (involving teammate Ketterson) limited his result — will want to make amends
- Part of the strongest US men's XC team in decades alongside Ogden and Schoonmaker
- "I was dead last after the fall" — the sprint offers a clean-slate redemption chance
