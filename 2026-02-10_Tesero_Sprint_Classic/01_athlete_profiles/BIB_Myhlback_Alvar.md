**Season Summary:** One World Cup podium (3rd, Trondheim classic sprint) which made him the youngest-ever WC sprint podium finisher. Struggled through the Tour de Ski, particularly in freestyle events, but showed strong classic sprint ability. His best results are clearly in classic sprint format. Tour de Ski was admittedly taxing — he said afterward: "It was tough for me to race the Tour de Ski, and even a few days afterward, it didn't feel good. But it has gotten better and better, and now I feel ready to compete again." — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/long-distance/myhlback-back-in-ski-classics-ready-to-race-again/)

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Elite — double-poling specialist of extraordinary power. Won 2024 Junior Worlds 10km classic by double-poling the entire course. Won Vasaloppet (90km classic) at age 18. Classic is his primary technique. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/brilliant-win-for-alvar-myhlback-at-the-planica-junior-world-championships/)
- **Freestyle strength:** Developing — struggled in freestyle events during Tour de Ski (46th in sprint F, 58th in 10km F). Clearly weaker in skating technique. [FIS TdS Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=CC&raceid=49549)
- **Sprint ability:** Emerging elite in classic sprint — 3rd at WC Trondheim, 9th at WC Ruka, qualified top 10 at Val di Fiemme TdS sprint. Exceptional double-poling power gives him a massive advantage in classic sprint format. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/12/klaebos-100th-norwegian-sprint-cauldron-boils-over-in-trondheim/)
- **Distance preference:** Long-distance / marathon specialist by trade (Vasaloppet, Ski Classics), but has shown he can compete in World Cup sprints.
- **Best format:** Classic sprint (individual) and long-distance classic marathons.
- **Climbing ability:** Strong — won Vasaloppet, which involves significant climbs, and has demonstrated power on uphills in sprint races. Hauled himself from 6th to 3rd on the final climb in Trondheim sprint final. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/12/klaebos-100th-norwegian-sprint-cauldron-boils-over-in-trondheim/)
- **Double-poling:** Extraordinary — his primary weapon. Perhaps the best double-poler of his generation. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/long-distance/broke-all-the-unwritten-rules-and-became-the-best/)

## Venue History (Tesero / Val di Fiemme)

| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-------|
| Jan 3, 2026 | Tour de Ski Stage 5 | Sprint Classic | **22nd** (qualified 10th) | Raced the exact Olympic sprint course. Eliminated in quarterfinals. [FIS Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=CC&raceid=49545) |
| Jan 4, 2026 | Tour de Ski Final | Final Climb (Alpe Cermis) | **40th overall** | Completed full Tour de Ski. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/tour-de-ski-2025-2026-final-standings/) |

**Key takeaway:** Myhlback has raced on the exact Olympic sprint course once before, at the Tour de Ski classic sprint on January 3, 2026. He qualified 10th — a promising sign — but was eliminated in the quarterfinals, likely fatigued from the multi-stage Tour. His qualification result (10th) better reflects his true ability on this course than his quarterfinal exit.

## Key Storylines

- **The youngest-ever prodigy:** At 19 years old, Myhlback is by far the youngest serious contender in the Olympic sprint field. He became the youngest Vasaloppet winner (90km) at age 18, and the youngest WC sprint podium finisher at age 19. He is a once-in-a-generation talent. [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-who-is-alvar-myhlback-the-youngest-ever-winner-of-the-vasaloppet-0302/)

- **Rebel path — chose Ski Classics over the national team:** After winning Vasaloppet 2025, Myhlback stunned the Swedish skiing establishment by declining to re-sign with the Swedish Ski Association and instead signing a 2-year deal with the Lager 157 Ski Team to focus on long-distance Ski Classics racing. His declared priority remains the Ski Classics overall title and defending his Vasaloppet crown. [Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/vasaloppet-champion-alvar-myhlback-chooses-lager-157-over-national-team) / [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-alvar-myhlback-ditches-the-swedish-national-team-to-sign-a-contract-with-the-lager-157-ski-team-and-focus-on-the-ski-classics-0503/)

- **"Surprise" Olympic call-up:** Despite his focus on long-distance racing, Myhlback's Trondheim WC podium in December 2025 made his Olympic selection inevitable. He was named to Sweden's Olympic team in December. Klaebo and Valnes publicly lobbied for his inclusion, with Klaebo saying "He has to go to the Olympics!" Myhlback later admitted: "I may not have been completely open and honest, but the thought of the Olympics has always been there." [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/young-sensation-has-klaebo-and-valnes-cheering-he-has-to-go-to-the-olympics/) / [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-its-impossible-to-deny-that-the-olympics-are-coming-at-just-the-right-time-prodigy-alvar-myhlback-opens-the-door-to-milan-cortina-2026-1204/)

- **Father as coach:** Much of Myhlback's development has come under the guidance of his father Petter Myhlback, an experienced coach and former Swedish national team wax technician. The two work closely together on technique, training, and race preparation. [Madshus](https://madshus.com/en-us/blog/p/alvar-myhlback---behind-the-stride)

- **Norwegian upbringing:** From ages 11 to 15, Myhlback's family lived in Trysil, Norway. He credits the isolation and skiing culture there with shaping his development: "There was so little to do that I ended up skiing for hours." [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-who-is-alvar-myhlback-the-youngest-ever-winner-of-the-vasaloppet-0302/)

- **Classic sprint is THE format:** The Olympic sprint is in classic technique — which is by far Myhlback's strongest discipline. His freestyle results are weak (46th in TdS sprint F), but in classic sprint he is a genuine medal threat. The format perfectly suits his extraordinary double-poling power. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/12/klaebos-100th-norwegian-sprint-cauldron-boils-over-in-trondheim/)

- **Tour de Ski fatigue factor:** Myhlback completed the full Tour de Ski (Dec 28 - Jan 4) just 5 weeks before the Olympic sprint. He admitted it was taxing and took time to recover. Whether he has fully recovered and peaked for February 10 is a key question. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/long-distance/myhlback-back-in-ski-classics-ready-to-race-again/)
