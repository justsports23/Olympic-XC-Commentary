## Venue History
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-------|

## Key Storylines
- Norway's 4th sprint entry — primarily entered for versatility and distance capabilities
- His sprint ability is solid but he is not a specialist — semifinal is likely his ceiling unless the course's demanding profile plays to his distance strength
- The 1,585m course with 49m climbing may favor his endurance over pure sprint specialists
- Set the pace in the Olympic skiathlon alongside Klæbo

## Personal Life & Commentary Notes

### Family
- From **Bleiker, Asker** — a suburb southwest of Oslo. Club: **Asker SK**.
- **Twin sister: Hedda Østberg Amundsen** — also on the **Norwegian national team** as a competitive XC skier. Opposite specialties: Harald does distance, Hedda does sprint. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedda_%C3%98stberg_Amundsen)
- **No connection to explorer Roald Amundsen** — "Amundsen" is a common Norwegian surname. Roald never married and had no children.
- **Girlfriend also named Hedda** (not his twin): *"I try to send my girlfriend out with her friends as much as possible, so she is occupied, and I can just train, eat, and sleep."* [Seher.no](https://www.seher.no/kjendis/hun-betyr-alt/82777169)

### Background
- At age 16, played football alongside **Sander Berge** (now Premier League) on Asker's youth team. Chose skiing over football.
- Studied **academic specialization** in secondary school with **no sports subjects** — deliberately, to think about something other than training.
- Went **skydiving** as mental training: *"I have been working a lot on pushing limits."* [Madshus](https://madshus.com/en-us/blog/p/went-skydiving-to-win-the-world-cup)
- Trains **860-900 hours/year**. Favorite dryland activity: long easy runs in the woods.
- Mindset: *"In my head, I see it as all or nothing. If I ski fast there, the rest of my career doesn't matter as much."*

### Top 3 Commentary Sound Bites
1. Twin sister Hedda is also on the Norwegian national team — the XC skiing twins of Norway
2. Played football with Premier League's Sander Berge as a teenager — chose skiing
3. Went skydiving to push his mental limits — the reigning World Cup champion fears nothing
