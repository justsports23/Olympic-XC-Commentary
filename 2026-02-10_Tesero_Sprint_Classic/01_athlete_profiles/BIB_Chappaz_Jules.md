## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Strong and improving. His Val di Fiemme Tour de Ski 2nd place (Jan 2026) was his first-ever World Cup classic sprint podium. Bronze at 2023 Worlds was also in classic sprint. Classic is now a proven weapon. | [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-tour-de-ski-good-reference-points-for-the-games-says-jules-chappaz-after-his-podium-finish-in-the-classic-sprint-in-val-di-fiemme-0103/)
- **Freestyle strength:** Very strong. Three of his four individual WC podiums came in freestyle sprints (Toblach 2023, Tallinn 2025, Lahti 2025). | [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-i-wanted-to-be-proud-of-myself-jules-chappaz-tells-us-after-finishing-second-in-the-tallinn-skate-sprint-0320/)
- **Sprint ability:** Elite. Sprint specialist ranked 5th in World Cup sprint standings. Consistently reaches finals at the highest level. | [FIS Cup Standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html)
- **Distance preference:** Sprint. Distance results are significantly weaker (67th at Trondheim 10km, ranked #293 in FIS distance points).
- **Best format:** Sprint (both classic and freestyle)
- **Climbing ability:** Uses creative tactics on climbs — at Ruka 2025, veered to the edge of the course on the final uphill to find better traction in less-compacted snow. Strong finisher on uphill sections. | [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/11/ruka-classic-sprint-the-klaebo-clinic/)

Chappaz has raced on the exact Olympic sprint course in its new 2026 configuration, finishing 2nd in the classic sprint just 38 days before the Olympic event. He described this as providing "good reference points for the Games." | [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-tour-de-ski-good-reference-points-for-the-games-says-jules-chappaz-after-his-podium-finish-in-the-classic-sprint-in-val-di-fiemme-0103/)

## Key Storylines

### First Olympic Race
Jules Chappaz is competing at his first-ever Olympic Games. The Men's Sprint Classic on February 10, 2026 in Tesero is his Olympic debut — a major milestone for the 26-year-old from Haute-Savoie. | [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-im-confident-and-i-feel-ready-jules-chappaz-who-was-ill-last-week-is-reassured-before-the-classic-sprint-0209/)

### Illness and Late Arrival
Chappaz was struck by gastroenteritis in the days before the Olympics. He was unable to travel to Italy as planned and only arrived in Val di Fiemme on Saturday, February 8 — just two days before the sprint. He put on skis for the first time on the Italian track on Monday morning (Feb 9) for his first intensive training session in a fortnight. He reported: "I'm feeling better. It was my first intensive training session in a fortnight. I've got my bearings, my energy is back up and I'm symptom-free." | [Nordic Mag (Feb 5)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-jules-chappaz-will-not-arrive-in-italy-until-saturday-due-to-illness-0205/) | [Nordic Mag (Feb 9)](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-im-confident-and-i-feel-ready-jules-chappaz-who-was-ill-last-week-is-reassured-before-the-classic-sprint-0209/)

### "I'm confident and I feel ready"
Despite the virus setback, Chappaz expressed strong confidence ahead of the sprint: **"I like the track, I'm confident and I feel ready. It was important to see what my body would say this morning. I'm happy with the way it's responding."** | [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-im-confident-and-i-feel-ready-jules-chappaz-who-was-ill-last-week-is-reassured-before-the-classic-sprint-0209/)

### Venue Familiarity — The Same Track
Chappaz finished 2nd in the classic sprint on this very course during the Tour de Ski on January 3, 2026 — just 38 days before the Olympic race. This familiarity is a significant advantage. He said after that Tour de Ski podium: "It was the most important day of the Tour de Ski. It was important to get our bearings for the Games, which will take place here in just over a month's time." | [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-tour-de-ski-good-reference-points-for-the-games-says-jules-chappaz-after-his-podium-finish-in-the-classic-sprint-in-val-di-fiemme-0103/)

### The Turning Point — Ready to Quit
In December 2024, Chappaz nearly walked away from the sport. He was described as being "ready to throw his skis and poles into the fire." But he instead flipped his approach to training, and everything changed. He went on to earn back-to-back World Cup podiums at Tallinn and Lahti, finish 4th at the Trondheim Worlds, and arrive at the Olympics as France's best sprinter of the winter. | [Madshus](https://madshus.com/en-us/blog/p/he-was-ready-to-quit-then-everything-changed) | [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/just-wanted-to-throw-away-his-skis-then-he-turned-everything-upside-down/)

### Rising Ambition
Chappaz has spoken openly about his medal ambitions: "I was on the podium several times last winter and came super close to a World Championship medal. So I know I can be right up there." He is also quoted as saying: "I'm capable of taking part in major events." | [Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-im-capable-of-taking-part-in-major-events-jules-chappaz-came-close-to-winning-a-second-consecutive-world-medal-in-trondheim-and-spoke-to-nordic-magazine-about-his-day-0227/)

### First Frenchman in History
At the 2023 Planica World Championships, Chappaz became the first Frenchman ever to win a sprint medal at the World Championships — a bronze in classic sprint. He was only the fifth Frenchman to win any individual medal at the Nordic Skiing World Championships. | [France24](https://www.france24.com/fr/info-en-continu/20230223-mondiaux-2023-chappaz-en-bronze-sur-le-sprint-derri%C3%A8re-klaebo-et-golberg)
