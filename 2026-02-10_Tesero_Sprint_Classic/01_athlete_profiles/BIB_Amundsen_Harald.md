**Season summary:** Amundsen has been the most consistent high-end performer of the 2025-26 season alongside Klaebo. He opened with a dominant 20km mass start freestyle win in Ruka (his 12th career WC victory), has held the distance World Cup lead, and sits 2nd overall. He finished 3rd in the Tour de Ski despite losing time on the Final Climb. Won the team sprint with Hedegart in Goms. Skipped Oberhof to focus on Olympic preparation. In his first Olympic race (skiathlon, Feb 8), he was a strong medal contender but fell after a collision with Savelii Korostelev (AIN) at 11.5km and finished 6th.

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Improved significantly in recent seasons. Won his first classic podium in Falun (2024-25). Bronze in 10km classic at 2025 Worlds. 3rd in 20km classic mass start in Goms (Jan 2026). Originally weaker in classic, now competitive across both techniques. "I've made big strides... I've had podiums in both classic and skate sprint, and I've got World Cup victories in distance races in both techniques." [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/no-shortcuts-to-success-how-preparation-became-amundsens-secret-weapon/)
- **Freestyle strength:** Elite — primary technique historically. Multiple freestyle distance wins (Ruka 20km, Holmenkollen 10km, Cogne 10km). Tour de Ski champion. Best climbing performances are in freestyle. [Madshus](https://madshus.com/en-us/blog/p/who-s-the-boss-)
- **Sprint ability:** Developing but not world-class. Made his first WC sprint final in Lahti (2024-25 season). Qualified 5th and reached the final in Ruka classic sprint (Nov 2025). Reached TdS sprint final (7th) in Toblach. Currently 11th in Sprint WC standings with 213 pts — respectable for a distance skier but well behind dedicated sprinters. His sprint entries at the Olympics reflect Norway's depth and his improving versatility, not sprint specialization. [NordicInsights](https://nordicinsights.news/2025/11/29/same-as-it-ever-was-klaebo-tops-all-norwegian-podium-in-ruka-classic-sprint/) [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/cross-country-world-cup-2025-2026-standings-after-goms/)
- **Distance preference:** Distance specialist — all 12+ career WC victories are in distance events (10km, 15km, 20km, skiathlon). His best results come at 15-20km and in mass start/pursuit formats. [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=197939)
- **Best format:** Mass start / Pursuit / Skiathlon — thrives in direct-comparison racing with tactical positioning and late-race surges. His Ruka 20km win featured a "late burst" after a broken pole. [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/amundsen-makes-late-burst-to-win-20k-in-ruka)
- **Climbing ability:** Strong — his Tour de Ski victory (2023-24) required conquering the Alpe Cermis Final Climb. 5th on the 2025-26 Final Climb (+30.1s). Good but not dominant on major climbs. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/stenshagen-wins-tour-de-ski-final-climb-klaebo-overall-winner/)

### Sprint Assessment for Olympic Classic Sprint
Amundsen is primarily a distance skier entered in the sprint. His sprint credentials are:
- Reached the Ruka classic sprint final (Nov 2025) — qualified 5th, advanced through QF and SF (as lucky loser), finished ~5th-6th in final
- Reached the Toblach TdS free sprint final (7th)
- 11th in Sprint World Cup standings (213 pts)
- His selection alongside Klaebo, Vike, and Valnes for the Olympic classic sprint reflects: (a) Norway's strategy of fielding four strong entries to maximize medal chances, (b) his improved sprint ability, and (c) his tactical racing intelligence in heats
- **Realistic sprint outcome:** Dark horse for semifinals/final; unlikely to medal unless the race develops favorably for his power profile. His strength lies in sustained power rather than explosive sprint finishing.

Amundsen's experience at Tesero/Val di Fiemme is limited to the 2025-26 Tour de Ski (where the race finished at Alpe Cermis, adjacent to the Tesero complex) and the Olympic skiathlon on February 8, 2026. He finished 5th on the Final Climb and 3rd overall in the Tour de Ski, then 6th in the Olympic skiathlon after a collision. He has **no previous sprint racing record at this venue**.

## Key Storylines

### Olympic Skiathlon Heartbreak — Collision with Korostelev (Feb 8, 2026)
Just two days before the sprint, Amundsen was involved in a race-altering incident in the skiathlon. At approximately 11.5km, he tangled with AIN athlete Savelii Korostelev. According to NRK, Korostelev hit Amundsen with his arm just as the Norwegian was losing balance. Amundsen went down; the lead group did not wait. He remounted quickly but the damage was done. A strong medal contender, he finished 6th. Korostelev apologized after the race: "I didn't see him. I'm so sorry." The key question for the sprint is whether Amundsen suffered any physical impact from the fall that could affect his sprint racing 48 hours later. [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-what-happened-between-norways-harald-oestberg-amundsen-and-russias-saveliy-korostelev-0208/) [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/47866086/johannes-hoesflot-klaebo-wins-skiathlon-6th-olympic-gold)

### Reigning World Cup Champion Chasing Olympic Gold
Amundsen is the reigning overall World Cup champion (2023-24) and current WC overall runner-up (2025-26). Despite his extraordinary domestic and World Cup success — including a Crystal Globe, Tour de Ski title, and 12+ WC wins — he has never won an Olympic individual medal. The 2026 Games represent his first real Olympic campaign (he was not selected for Beijing 2022). His primary medal targets are likely the 10km classic and 50km mass start later in the Games, but the sprint entry gives him an additional chance. [Alpina](https://www.alpinasports.com/en/news/harald-amundsen-wins-the-crystal-globe-in-style-) [daehl-e](https://www.daehl-e.com/post/cross-country/season-preview/20262/)

### Distance Skier in a Sprint Race — Norway's Tactical Depth Play
Amundsen is one of Norway's four sprint entries alongside Klaebo (the overwhelming favorite), Valnes (the experienced sprint specialist), and Vike (the breakout young sprinter). Norway's strategy of including a distance powerhouse in the sprint field reflects: (1) Amundsen's genuine improvement in sprint racing this season, (2) his ability to set pace in heats and make races harder for rivals, and (3) the risk management of having four separate Norwegians who can each independently reach the knockout rounds, maximizing the odds of multiple Norwegians in the final. [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-norway-announces-the-names-of-its-athletes-for-the-start-of-the-skiathlon-and-classic-sprint-events-0205/) [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/01/the-cost-of-being-the-best-norway-finally-locks-in-its-olympic-squad/)

### Twin Siblings at the Olympics
Harald and his twin sister Hedda Østberg Amundsen are both competing at the 2026 Olympics. The "Norwegian turbo twins" are both elite cross-country skiers, with Hedda also competing on the women's side. Both are Madshus athletes. [Madshus](https://madshus.com/en-us/blog/p/the-stuff-that-champions-are-made-of)

### Overall World Cup Race with Klaebo
The sprint counts toward the overall World Cup standings, and Amundsen trails Klaebo in the overall. Every point matters in their season-long battle. While Klaebo is the dominant sprint force, Amundsen has consistently collected sprint points this season (213 pts, 11th in sprint standings) — more evidence that he races sprints not just for individual glory but for the overall campaign. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/cross-country-world-cup-2025-2026-standings-after-goms/)

### The HØAnton Scholarship — Giving Back
Despite his competitive intensity, Amundsen is known for philanthropy. Together with his personal sponsor Anton Sport, he launched the HØAnton scholarship — two stipends of 20,000 NOK each per year plus gift cards for young aspiring cross-country skiers. He has publicly stated he donates portions of his prize money. [Langrenn.com](https://www.langrenn.com/langrenn-allround/harald-ostberg-amundsen-gir-bort-deler-av-premiepengene-sine/)
