**Season summary:** A mixed season by Anger's standards, with three World Cup podiums (3rd Ruka distance, 3rd TdS Toblach pursuit, 3rd Goms sprint), plus a dominant win at the Gallivare Swedish opening and a Swedish Cup sprint win at Falun. He has struggled in classic sprints at World Cup level earlier in the season, being eliminated in all quarter-finals in that discipline, before breaking through with his 3rd-place finish at Goms. His distance results have been inconsistent, ranging from strong podium finishes (Ruka, Toblach TdS) to poor outings (55th Trondheim, 36th Val di Fiemme). Currently 6th overall and 3rd in the sprint standings.

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** Strong and rapidly improving. Won the Les Rousses classic sprint (WC), the Gallivare 10km classic by 39.5 seconds, and the Falun Swedish Cup classic sprint. Has been working specifically on hip stability and technique refinement in classic. His initial career success was in freestyle/skate, but classic has become a genuine weapon. He has noted: "I'm just trying to keep my hips stable and trying not to allow myself to fall into my old habits." [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/01/edvin-anger-powers-to-les-rousses-sprint-win-schoonmaker-fifth/) [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-gallivare-edvin-anger-dominates-the-individual-classic-1122/)
- **Freestyle strength:** Excellent — this was his original stronger technique. Finished 2nd in the Engadin freestyle sprint behind Klaebo (+0.20 sec). Podium in the 20km freestyle mass start at Ruka. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2025/01/the-boys-are-back-klaebo-schools-anger-in-engadin-freestyle-sprint/)
- **Sprint ability:** Elite. 3rd in Sprint World Cup standings. Powerful front-runner who uses his 193cm frame and ~100kg body weight to generate massive power on uphills, creating separation in sprint courses. Has been Klaebo's primary non-Norwegian rival in sprint racing over the past two seasons. [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-shows-olympic-form-with-goms-sprint-victory) [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/cross-country-world-cup-2025-2026-standings-after-goms/)
- **Distance preference:** Improving all-rounder with sprint base. 2024-25 saw a jump from 43rd to 13th in Distance WC standings. Strong in pursuits and mass starts where he can use his sprint finish. Less competitive in pure interval start distance races. [daehl-e](https://www.daehl-e.com/post/cross-country/season-preview/20262/)
- **Best format:** Sprint (both techniques) and mass start distance races where his finishing speed is an asset.
- **Climbing ability:** Very strong climber in sprint-length efforts. His power-to-weight ratio may look unfavorable on paper given his size, but in sprint courses he uses his raw power on climbs to create decisive gaps. In the Les Rousses final, he pushed the pace from the start up to the top of the course. Less competitive on long sustained climbs (e.g., Alpe Cermis).

## Venue History
| Date | Event | Discipline | Result | Time Back |
|------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Jan 3, 2026 | TdS Sprint Classic | Val di Fiemme | 14th (Qual: 16th) | [DATA NOT FOUND] |
| Jan 4, 2026 | TdS 10km Free Mass Start | Val di Fiemme | 36th | [DATA NOT FOUND] |

Anger's only racing experience at the Val di Fiemme / Tesero complex came during the 2025-26 Tour de Ski in January 2026. His results there were below his best level: 14th in the classic sprint (after qualifying only 16th) and 36th in the 10km freestyle mass start. Notably, the TdS sprint was raced on the **newly built Olympic sprint course** at Tesero, which was debuted during the 2026 Tour de Ski. This gives him direct course knowledge of the exact Olympic track, though his 14th-place result suggests he may have been fatigued from the multi-day Tour format rather than showing his true sprint ability on the course.

## Key Storylines

### Olympic Medal as Primary Season Goal
Anger has stated that an individual Olympic medal is his "absolute top priority, no question about it." The entire 2025-26 season has been structured around peaking for Milano Cortina. He was one of the first five Swedish skiers confirmed for the Olympics (announced May 2025), alongside Jonna Sundling, Frida Karlsson, Ebba Andersson, and William Poromaa — all five had won medals at the 2025 Trondheim World Championships. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/anger-hires-his-father-with-the-goal-of-winning-an-olympic-medal/) [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/five-swedish-cross-country-skiers-confirmed-for-the-winter-olympics-2026/)

### "Following Klaebo's Playbook" — Building a Personal Team
After his breakthrough 2024-25 season, Anger made a bold move: he fired his agent and built a personal team modeled on Johannes Klaebo's structure. His father, Fredrik Anger (who runs a sports store in Hedemora), was hired part-time as sports director handling sponsors and partnerships. Brand strategist Mattias Bangman handles communication and social media. Fredrik Anger visited Klaebo's father Haakon, who was "completely open about everything — what they did and how they work today." The annual budget is approximately 4.5 million SEK (~400,000 EUR), funded by sponsors including mining company Boliden and billionaire investor Christer Gardell (co-founder of Cevian Capital), plus Anger's own prize money (~145,000 EUR from 2024-25). [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/fired-his-agent-now-hes-following-klaebos-playbook-to-become-the-best-in-the-world/) [NordicMag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-swedens-edvin-anger-surrounds-himself-with-a-close-knit-guard-0604/)

### Body Image and Size — "I Felt Too Heavy to Succeed"
At 193cm and over 100kg, Anger is one of the biggest athletes on the World Cup circuit. As a young skier, he was ashamed of his weight and sometimes deliberately lost weight so he could say he weighed 90kg instead of 95kg. He has since embraced his size as a strength: "I used to be ashamed of my weight. You're more insecure when you're younger. Now that I'm older and more confident, I've turned that into a strength instead of a weakness." This summer, he ran a 10K in 31:37 while weighing over 100kg — possibly an unofficial world record for that weight class. [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympic-favorite-opens-up-i-felt-too-heavy-to-succeed/)

### Goms Sprint Breakthrough
After being eliminated in all classic sprint quarter-finals earlier in the 2025-26 World Cup season, Anger's 3rd-place finish at Goms (Jan 24) was a significant confidence boost heading into the Olympics. "It was pretty important. I've been struggling a bit with the Sprints and not really got it the way I've wanted, especially in Classic style." He described it as "a great confirmation of where I'm at to make it to my first final." [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/klaebo-shows-olympic-form-with-goms-sprint-victory)

### Klaebo Rivalry
Anger has emerged as Klaebo's most consistent non-Norwegian challenger. In the 2024-25 season, he was the only skier to keep pace with Klaebo in the overall standings (finishing 2nd with 1,731 pts). In sprint finals, Klaebo has typically been the superior finisher, but Anger's front-running style and climbing power have made him the most dangerous rival. At Goms, Klaebo pushed Anger into the lead in both the semifinal and final before surging past on the final climb.

### Best Swedish Male Skier in 20+ Years
Anger's 2nd-place overall finish in 2024-25 was the best result by a Swedish male cross-country skier in the World Cup overall standings in over 20 years. He was the first Swede to win a World Cup race since Marcus Hellner in 2017, ending a 1,442-day win drought for Sweden. [FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/swede-victory-anger-roars-to-first-world-cup-win-in-les-rousses-sprint)

### First Senior Olympics
Despite his Youth Olympic gold in 2020 and his World Championships experience, Milano Cortina 2026 will be Anger's first senior Olympic Games.
