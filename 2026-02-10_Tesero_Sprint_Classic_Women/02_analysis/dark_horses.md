# Dark Horses — Women's Sprint Classic

## Three Athletes Who Could Surprise the World

### 1. Johanna MATINTALO (FIN) — Bib 26
**Why she could surprise:** Won her first-ever World Cup race (20km classic mass start) just **16 days** before this Olympic sprint. Finished 5th in the Goms classic sprint final the day before. Her former **800m national championship** running background gives her unique physical tools on a climbing course — sustained power that pure sprinters don't have.

**The evidence:**
- First WC win, 16 days before the Olympics = peak form
- 5th in Goms classic sprint final = sprint finalist-capable
- 800m runner's VO2 max on a course with 49m total climb = natural advantage
- Finnish wax team is excellent in zero-zone conditions

**Realistic ceiling:** Medal (bronze)
**Floor:** Quarterfinals

### 2. Sammy SMITH (USA) — Bib 5
**Why she could surprise:** A 20-year-old dual-sport phenomenon who went from the NCAA soccer College Cup Final to winning both U.S. sprint championships to reaching World Cup **semifinals** (12th at Oberhof — top American) in her WC debut. Raw athletic talent that transcends individual sports. Olympic debut adrenaline could push her to extraordinary heights.

**The evidence:**
- WC semifinal on debut = she can compete at the top level RIGHT NOW
- 9+ sports growing up = unmatched athletic versatility
- Classic sprint U.S. champion = technique is there
- Rooming with Jessie Diggins = learning from the GOAT

**Realistic ceiling:** Semifinal (7th-12th)
**Floor:** Quarterfinals (13th-30th)

### 3. Gina DEL RIO ROCA (AND) — Bib 21
**Why she could surprise:** Andorra's 22-year-old star finished **10th at the 2025 World Championship sprint** and qualified **15th** at the Val di Fiemme TdS classic sprint — she knows this course. World Junior Champion in sprint. Her talent transcends her tiny nation's resources.

**The evidence:**
- 10th at World Championships = proven championship performer
- 15th in Val di Fiemme TdS qualifier = course knowledge
- U23 World Cup leader = dominating her age group globally
- Trains with French development team = strong preparation

**Realistic ceiling:** Quarterfinal (13th-18th)
**Floor:** Top 30 qualification

## Honorable Mentions

### Katerina JANATOVA (CZE) — Bib 15
7th in the Olympic skiathlon (Feb 7) — in the shape of her life. If distance fitness translates on this climbing course, she could qualify and shock in the heats.

### Jasmin KAHARA (FIN) — Bib 22
Made her first WC sprint final in December (4th). Finland's sprint depth is historically good — she could ride the Finnish wax advantage and tactical awareness deep into the knockout rounds.

### Milla Andreassen (NOR) — Bib 9
Double Junior World Champion. 8th at Oberhof. Only 20 years old. Norway's next generation could announce itself on the Olympic stage.
