- The course has been **extended to 1,547m** for the Olympics, significantly longer than prior Val di Fiemme sprint layouts (~1,200m)
- The February 7 skiathlon at this venue provided course familiarity for athletes who raced it (Diggins, Sundling, Kern, Weber, Janatova, and others)
- Sweden enters with four legitimate gold contenders (Svahn, Sundling, Dahlqvist, Hagström) — the deepest single-nation sprint squad in Olympic history
