# Course Profile — Women's Sprint Classic

## Course Specifications
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| **Course Name** | Red 1.5 km Sprint |
| **Length** | 1,547 m |
| **Height Difference (HD)** | 23 m |
| **Maximum Climb (MC)** | 23 m |
| **Total Climb (TC)** | 49 m |
| **Laps** | 1 |
| **Stadium Altitude** | ~830 m |

## Elevation Profile Description

The course features **two distinct climbs** totaling 49 meters of vertical gain:

1. **Main Climb (23m):** A sustained climb that accounts for the full height difference. This is the decisive tactical section where breakaways are made. Jasmi Joensuu's Tour de Ski victory was sealed on this climb when she "broke cleanly away from everyone else."

2. **Secondary Climb (~26m cumulative):** A second climb section that adds to the total vertical, making this an unusually demanding sprint course.

## Key Sections
- **Technical bends:** Multiple direction changes that reward good ski handling and create overtaking opportunities in knockout rounds
- **Sustained main climb:** The 23m climb heavily favors endurance sprinters with strong diagonal stride over pure double-pole speedsters
- **Final downhill:** Where Joensuu's "speedy skis broke cleanly away" during the TdS — wax quality matters here
- **Stadium finish:** Layout requires positioning before the final stretch

## Course Characteristics
- **Extended length:** At 1,547m, this is significantly longer than the ~1,200m layout used at this venue in 2022-23. Winning times at the TdS were ~3:45 compared to ~3:06 on the shorter course
- **Endurance-biased:** The two-climb profile and extended length favor athletes with distance endurance, not pure double-pole speedsters
- **Classic technique demands:** The sustained 23m climb is extremely difficult to double-pole entirely in race conditions — efficient diagonal stride with reliable kick wax is essential
- **Cumulative fatigue:** Athletes must potentially complete 5 races in one day (qual + QF + SF + Final). The repeated 49m of climbing per run adds up to ~245m total vertical across all rounds
