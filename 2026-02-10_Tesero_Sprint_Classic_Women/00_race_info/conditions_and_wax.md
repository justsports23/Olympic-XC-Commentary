## Temperature Context
- These conditions are **warmer than the February average** for Tesero (typical highs of 1.2°C)
- The February 7 skiathlon experienced **5°C temperatures, 94% humidity**, and "energy-draining wet snow" on artificial surfaces
- Temperature may change between qualification start (09:15) and finals (11:45), potentially affecting wax performance across rounds

## The Zero-Zone Wax Challenge

Conditions sit squarely in the dreaded **"zero zone" (−1°C to +3°C)** — the most challenging temperature range for classic wax selection.

### Key Wax Considerations
- **Grip wax is non-negotiable** on the 23m main climb — poor grip means catastrophic time loss in sprint format
- Wax technicians face choices between violet hard waxes, klister overlays, and sophisticated layered combinations
- Machine-made snow at warm temperatures becomes wet, abrasive, and glazed, wearing grip wax faster
- Athletes racing multiple rounds (up to 5 runs) need wax that maintains grip over 45+ minutes of cumulative racing
- **Glide wax** also critical — Joensuu's TdS win was aided by "speedy skis" on the final downhill

### Snow Surface
- **Artificial/machine-made snow** on the Olympic course
- Warm temperatures create wet, heavy conditions that differ significantly from natural cold snow
- The skiathlon (Feb 7) demonstrated that conditions at Tesero can be "brutally tricky"

## Team Wax Service Rankings (Estimated)
Teams with the strongest classic wax technicians hold significant advantages in zero-zone conditions:

1. **Sweden** — Frida Karlsson reportedly had "super skis" at the skiathlon; Sweden's service team is considered among the world's best
2. **Finland** — Joensuu benefited from "speedy skis" at the TdS, suggesting excellent wax preparation
3. **Switzerland** — Strong alpine nation with extensive experience in variable conditions
4. **Norway** — Deep resources and expertise, though historically sometimes caught out in warm conditions

## Impact Assessment
- A poorly waxed ski on the 23m climb could cost **3-5 seconds** — enough to eliminate a medal contender in qualification or determine knockout heat outcomes
- The team with the best wax technicians may determine the podium as much as the athletes' legs
- Early qualifiers (low bibs) may face different snow conditions than later qualifiers as temperature rises through the morning
