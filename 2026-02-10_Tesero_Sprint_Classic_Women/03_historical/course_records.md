### Historical Context
- The extended 1,547m course was first used in the 2024-25 Tour de Ski season
- Previous shorter layout (~1,200m) produced times of approximately 3:06
- The ~40-second increase reflects the significantly longer and more demanding course
- Olympic final times may differ from TdS times due to:
  - Different snow/weather conditions (February vs. January)
  - Fresher athletes (Olympic sprint vs. TdS Stage 5 fatigue)
  - Stronger overall field (top sprinters absent from TdS present at Olympics)
