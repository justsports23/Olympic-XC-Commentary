## The Person Behind the Skis

### The American College Detour
Joensuu's path to Olympic contention is unlike any other athlete in this field. After growing up in Finland, she enrolled at the **University of Denver** in Colorado, where she earned a **bachelor's degree in finance with a marketing minor**. She made the Dean's List and was a **3-time All-America selection** and part of **two NCAA Championship skiing teams** (2016 and 2018).

Living in America as a young Finnish woman, she found deep friendships that replaced family: *"I like to be with my friends, as my family is not here. My friends are kind of a family to me in Denver."* — [DU Clarion](https://duclarion.com/2017/05/pio-bio-jasmi-joensuu/)

While her Swedish and Norwegian rivals were in national development programs, Joensuu was balancing college exams with collegiate racing — a non-traditional path that delayed her World Cup breakthrough but gave her mental toughness and independence.

### Family & Skiing Heritage
Joensuu started skiing at **age 2**: *"My parents also skied nordic when they were kids, so they took me right away with them and I was on skis for the first time at the age of two."* Both parents were recreational cross-country skiers who passed on their love of the sport.

She currently works at **Activebrands Finland** alongside her racing career — a reminder that not every Olympic contender is a full-time professional athlete.

### The Late Bloomer
Joensuu didn't win her first individual World Cup race until **age 29** — at the Val di Fiemme TdS classic sprint on January 3, 2026. That patience and persistence, honed through her unconventional American college path, is central to who she is.

## The Course Winner — "I Wanted a Good Feeling"

### Tour de Ski Val di Fiemme Sprint (January 3, 2026)
Joensuu won qualifying AND the final on the **exact Olympic course**, clocking **3:45.75**. She broke cleanly away on the final climb — her endurance-sprint profile perfectly suited to the demanding Tesero course.

After winning, she was measured in her celebration: *"I wanted a good feeling with this course, and I've managed to do that, but the Olympics is a different race."* [UNVERIFIED EXACT WORDING — paraphrased in preview document; original source not located] — showing the Finnish pragmatism that defines her character.

### Sprint Crystal Globe — Historic Achievement
In 2024-25, Joensuu won the **Sprint Crystal Globe** — becoming only the **second Finnish woman ever** to achieve this, after the legendary Virpi Kuitunen in 2007. She ended Sweden's stranglehold on the title (Swedish women had won it every year since 2021-22).

## Key Storylines
1. **The course winner:** Won on this exact course five weeks ago — the strongest course-specific form indicator in the field
2. **University of Denver graduate:** Finance degree, All-American, college ski champion — the non-traditional path
3. **Historic Sprint Globe:** Only the 2nd Finnish woman to win the sprint crystal globe in 18 years
4. **Olympic is different:** Her own words — she knows the TdS win means nothing if she can't repeat it under Olympic pressure
5. **Goms 9th:** Her most recent result was a disappointing 9th — she can have off-days in knockout rounds

## Commentary Gold
- **American college graduate** racing for Olympic gold — the University of Denver Pioneers connection
- *"My friends are kind of a family to me in Denver"* — the lonely immigrant student who became a World Cup champion
- Started skiing at age 2 because her parents loved cross-country skiing
- Works at Activebrands Finland alongside her racing career — not a full-time athlete
- The **Finnish wax team** is considered among the best in the world — her "speedy skis" at TdS could be decisive again
- If she wins, it's Finland's first Olympic XC sprint gold since... ever
