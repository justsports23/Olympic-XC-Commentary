## The Person Behind the Skis

### The Late Bloomer's Renaissance
Drivenes is experiencing a sporting "renaissance" after years outside the World Cup circuit. She won the **10km skate at Norwegian opening races in Beitostolen** (November 2025) — described as the *"sensation"* of the weekend, beating established national team members.

Her distance form is excellent: Ruka 10km Classic: 11th, Davos 10km Free: 11th. But she's **more of a distance skier** — her TdS sprint result (24th) is weaker. First Olympics at 26 after years of patience.

**Commentary Gold:** The "sensation" at Beitostolen — a late bloomer who suddenly emerged at 26. More distance than sprint, but her endurance on this climbing course could be valuable. First Olympics after years of believing she'd never get here.
