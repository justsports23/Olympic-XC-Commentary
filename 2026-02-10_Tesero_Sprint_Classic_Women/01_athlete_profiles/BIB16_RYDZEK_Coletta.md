## The Person Behind the Skis

### The Rydzek Family — Olympic Pedigree
Coletta is the **youngest child and only daughter** of **Michael and Marlene Rydzek**. Her older brother **Johannes Rydzek** is a Nordic combined **Olympic champion** and multiple World Championship gold medalist — one of the most decorated athletes in Nordic combined history. Her other brother **Simon Rydzek** was also a Nordic combined skier who attended the Skigymnasium Oberstdorf before ending his career at 16 to focus on his Abitur (now studying Chemistry in Munich).

*"My brothers were always role models for me from the start and through the major events in my hometown Oberstdorf."* — [Zoll Online](https://www.zoll.de/DE/Der-Zoll/Zollskiteam/Unser-Team/Skilanglauf/Rydzek-Coletta/rydzek-coletta.html)

### Why Cross-Country, Not Nordic Combined?
Unlike her brothers, Coletta chose **pure cross-country skiing** rather than Nordic combined. The reason? She found ski jumping *"frightening as a young child"* and instead embraced *"the accessibility and joy of gliding on the trails with friends in the local ski club."* [Quotes from [Zoll Online](https://www.zoll.de/DE/Der-Zoll/Zollskiteam/Unser-Team/Skilanglauf/Rydzek-Coletta/rydzek-coletta.html); UNVERIFIED EXACT ENGLISH WORDING — translated from German]

She first stood on cross-country skis at **age 3**. [UNVERIFIED — attributed in preview document]

### Chronic Fatigue — The Lost Season
Gimmler isn't the only Oberstdorf skier who waited years for a breakthrough. Rydzek dealt with **chronic fatigue syndrome** for nearly a year and a half during her Abitur years. She was very often sick, eventually had her **tonsils removed**, and **did not contest any races in the 2017-18 season** — focusing entirely on getting healthy. She revealed these health struggles in a podcast interview. [UNVERIFIED — chronic fatigue details attributed in preview document; specific podcast source not located]

### Education
She completed her **Abitur** at the Skigymnasium Oberstdorf — the same school as teammate Laura Gimmler.

## The Freestyle Sprinter's Classic Problem

### The Technique Gap
Rydzek's season tells two different stories depending on technique:

**Freestyle sprints:** 2nd at Oberhof, 2nd at Toblach TdS — legitimate medal contender
**Classic sprints:** 8th at Trondheim, 24th at Ruka, **27th at Goms** — struggling badly

The Olympic sprint is classic. Her most recent classic sprint result (27th at Goms, January 24) is deeply concerning — that was just 17 days before this race.

## Commentary Gold
- **Brother is an Olympic champion** in Nordic combined — the family pedigree
- Chose cross-country over ski jumping because jumping was *"frightening as a young child"*
- **Chronic fatigue syndrome** cost her an entire season — she knows what it means to fight back
- First stood on skis at **age 3** — Oberstdorf children practically grow up on them
- The **classic vs. freestyle gap** is the story: she's world-class in the wrong technique for today's race
- Won team sprint with Gimmler at Goms — the Oberstdorf partnership could matter in heats
