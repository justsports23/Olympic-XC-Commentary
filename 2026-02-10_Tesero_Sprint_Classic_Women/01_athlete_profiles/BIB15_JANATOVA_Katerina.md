## The Person Behind the Skis

### The Distance Skier in Sprint Clothing
Janatova is primarily a distance skier who produced a stunning **7th place in the Olympic skiathlon on February 7** — one of the best results of her career, showing she's in peak form. However, her sprint qualifying results are weaker (33rd Ruka, 42nd Trondheim).

The skiathlon 7th suggests she's in the shape of her life — but the sprint format may not favor her profile. The demanding Tesero course with its climbs could help bridge the gap between her distance fitness and sprint speed.

**Commentary Gold:** 7th in the skiathlon three days ago — in the form of her life. If distance fitness translates to sprint endurance on this climbing course, she could surprise. Czech dark horse.
