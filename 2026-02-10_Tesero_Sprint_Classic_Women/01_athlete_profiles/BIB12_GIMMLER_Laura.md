## The Person Behind the Skis

### Oberstdorf — Born Where Legends Ski
Gimmler grew up in **Oberstdorf** — one of Germany's most famous winter sports towns, host of World Cup events and the 2021 World Championships. Her parents put her on cross-country skis at **age 5**, and she attended the **Skigymnasium Oberstdorf** (ski boarding school), completing her **Abitur (German university-entrance exam) in 2014** at age 20.

The defining childhood moment: watching the **2005 World Championships in her hometown** of Oberstdorf. That's when she knew she wanted to be a professional cross-country skier.

### Personal Life
Her current partner is **Cyprien Sarrazin**, a French Alpine ski racer — another cross-border skiing romance. Previously, she was in a long-term relationship with German skier Florian Notz (2013-2025).

### Career Breakthrough at 32
Gimmler's story is one of **extraordinary patience**. She spent years as a solid top-15 performer — always competitive, never quite breaking through. Then, at **age 32**, everything clicked:
- Career-best **2nd place** in classic sprint at Goms (January 24, 2026) — beaten only by Svahn by **0.12 seconds in the A Final** — [FIS Results](https://medias4.fis-ski.com/pdf/2026/CC/2241/2026CC2241RL.pdf)
- Won **team sprint** with Coletta Rydzek at Goms the day before

After that 2nd-place finish, she was overwhelmed: *"It's incredible, it's insane. I can't believe it. I was so tired in the morning, and I kept saying to myself, 'I don't have that much energy left from yesterday, it's OK not to be that strong today.' Then it surprisingly got better and better."* [UNVERIFIED EXACT WORDING — attributed in preview document; original German-language source not located; the 2nd-place result itself is verified via [FIS Results](https://medias4.fis-ski.com/pdf/2026/CC/2241/2026CC2241RL.pdf)]

### On Olympic Pressure
In a moment of refreshing honesty, she said: *"I believe everyone who stands here and has big plans has some fear somewhere, and whoever doesn't admit that is not honest."* [UNVERIFIED EXACT WORDING — attributed in preview document]

### Personal Motto
*"If you can't stop thinking about it, don't stop working for it."* [UNVERIFIED — attributed as personal motto in preview document]
