## The Person Behind the Skis

### From the Track to the Trail — The 800m Champion
Before she ever raced on snow at the elite level, Matintalo was a **Finnish national champion in the 800 meters** (2013). She set age-group records as a middle-distance runner and was part of Finland's athletics pipeline.

But injuries plagued her running career — her personal best in the 800m, set in 2011, she could never improve upon. At the youth level, training for skiing and running were compatible, but at the elite level they became incompatible: skiing demanded **far more upper-body strength and mass**, which would slow her on the track.

In **2016**, she made the agonizing choice to **drop athletics entirely** and concentrate on cross-country skiing. She moved from southwestern Finland to **Rovaniemi** — far above the Arctic Circle — to access better training conditions. That sacrifice of one dream for another is now paying off on the Olympic stage.

### Partner: Lauri Vuorinen
Matintalo's husband is **Lauri Vuorinen**, a Finnish cross-country skier who won **bronze in the sprint at the 2025 World Championships** in Trondheim. They are one of Finland's top sporting couples — both chasing medals at the highest level.

### Peak Form: First WC Win 16 Days Before the Olympics
At Goms on January 25, 2026, Matintalo won her **first-ever individual World Cup race** — the 20km Classic Mass Start. The day before, she finished **5th in the classic sprint final**. She captured the feeling perfectly: *"Of course, it's great before the Olympics to be in your best shape of the season."*
