Swiss A-team member. **2025 World Championship Bronze in Team Sprint Classic** with Fähndrich at Trondheim. Goms classic sprint qualifier: 18th. Finished 25th in the Olympic skiathlon (Feb 7) — she has fresh course familiarity. More of a team sprint specialist than individual medal contender. Typical WC sprint range: 14th-21st in qualifying.
