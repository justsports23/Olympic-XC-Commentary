## The Person Behind the Skis

### "The Glitter Fairy" — America's Most Joyful Athlete
Diggins is known as **"the Glitter Fairy"** by her teammates. Before every race, she decorates her cheeks with **biodegradable glitter** and face paint — a tradition dating back to **Stillwater High School** in Minnesota.

*"Putting glitter on before a race is this reminder to myself that I get to do this, that I have to remember to have fun."* She describes herself as *"the sparkly chipmunk that I am."*

### Family — Skiing in the Blood
- **Parents:** Clay and Deb Diggins met at **Gustavus Adolphus College** in Minnesota
- **Husband:** Wade Poplawski — a former **Canadian ice hockey player**, now a financial analyst in Boston. They met at a friend's wedding in 2015 and married in May 2022
- The family joined the **Minnesota Youth Ski League** when Jessie was young, spending every Sunday afternoon all winter playing games on skis
- Her first memory of skiing: *"Yelling 'mush' at my dad from his backpack"* and pulling his hair yelling **"FASTER"** — [JessieDiggins.com](https://jessiediggins.com/about-2/)

### The Eating Disorder — "It Saved My Life"
At **age 18**, Diggins struggled with **bulimia**. Her parents found The Emily Program, a treatment center, and the intervention *"saved her life."* She wrote the autobiography **"Brave Enough"** (2020) documenting her struggle and recovery, hoping to help others facing similar challenges.

She is now an **ambassador for The Emily Program**, describing this advocacy work as *"the most impactful and rewarding experience of my entire career"* — more meaningful than any gold medal. — [JessieDiggins.com](https://jessiediggins.com/eating-disorders-awareness-week-and-a-brave-enough-book-excerpt/)

### Renaissance Woman
- Took **dance classes for 10 years**: *"I was never that good, but I LOVED it. Blame that for my love of glitter and pink."*
- Choreographed the viral **"Uptown Funk" music video** with the U.S. Ski Team
- Chases adrenaline: **cliff jumping, bungee jumping, skydiving**
- **Climate change advocate** — uses her platform to speak about environmental protection
- Post-retirement goal: run a **100-mile trail ultramarathon**
- First American to receive the **Holmenkollen Medal** (2024) — Norway's highest skiing honor

### The Farewell Tour
This is Diggins' **fourth and final Olympic Games**. She announced her retirement in November 2025, with her final race at the **Lake Placid World Cup Finals** in March 2026. She's pursuing her **4th consecutive Overall Crystal Globe** — unprecedented in women's XC history.

An individual Olympic gold is the one achievement that would cap the most legendary career in American cross-country skiing history. Her desire to potentially start a family with husband Wade was part of the retirement decision.
