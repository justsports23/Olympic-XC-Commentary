## The Person Behind the Skis

### From Tiny Andorra, Population 88,000
Gina del Rio Roca represents **Andorra** — a microstate of ~88,000 people nestled between France and Spain in the Pyrenees. Cross-country skiing is not a traditional sport there; alpine skiing dominates. Only **two Andorran athletes** compete at the highest international XC level: Gina and **Irineu Esteve Altimiras**.

*"It's a small country and cross-country skiing is not super traditional there. Getting good results, being from Andorra, is not easy. We don't have as many resources as Norway, Sweden or the other big countries."* — [Salomon](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/athlete/gina-del-rio-roca)

### Training with the French
Without a national XC infrastructure, del Rio trains regularly with **Les Bleuettes** — the French women's development team. She benefits from Andorra's **natural altitude** for training while accessing French coaching and competition networks.

### Tour de Ski Childhood Memories
*"I remember watching it during the holidays with my family when I was younger. I really like the Tour de Ski, especially the Final Climb."* — This January, she raced her first TdS at the venue she watched as a child.

### World Junior Champion
Despite coming from a tiny nation, del Rio won the **World Junior Championship** in sprint skate at Planica (2023-24 season) — proving that talent transcends national resources.

### 10th at the World Championships
Her **10th-place finish at the 2025 World Championship sprint** in Trondheim was the second-best result in Andorran sporting history. She was overcome with emotion: *"It feels amazing to represent Andorra because it's a small country."*

### Other Sports
She also competes in **mountain biking and road cycling** — the endurance foundation for a multi-sport athlete.
