## The Person Behind the Skis

### The International Love Story — "We Met on Tinder"
Dahlqvist's partner is **Kevin Bolger** (32), an American cross-country skier from **Minocqua, Wisconsin**. They matched on **Tinder** during the 2020-21 season and confirmed their relationship during the 2021 World Championships in Oberstdorf. They've been living together for over three years — one of cross-country skiing's highest-profile international couples.

The story gets deeper: despite seven years on the U.S. national team and 130+ World Cup starts, Bolger was **not named to the official 2025-26 U.S. Cross Country Ski Team** — [US Ski & Snowboard](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/2025-26-stifel-us-cross-country-ski-team-announced) — despite being the 2025 U.S. national classic sprint champion. He was retained by **Team Birkie** — [Team Birkie](https://www.teambirkie.com/news/team-announcement-for-2025-2026-season) — and has continued competing at World Cups through discretionary selections. The contrast between Maja's fully-funded spot on Sweden's dominant team and Kevin's more precarious funding situation remains stark. — [Nordic Insights](https://nordicinsights.news/2023/10/05/from-sweden-with-love-jc-schoonmaker-emma-ribom-kevin-bolger-maja-dahlqvist-but-visa-issues-loom/)

Beyond making the Olympic team, Maja and Kevin share a dream: *finding a place to live together in Falun* — Maja's hometown and host of the 2027 World Championships. — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/cross-country-ski-stars-reveal-secret-dream-its-not-just-about-skiing/)

### Hometown: Falun — The Heart of Swedish Skiing
Dahlqvist is from **Borlänge** but based in **Falun** — the spiritual home of Swedish cross-country skiing and site of the famous Lugnet ski stadium. Growing up in Dalarna province, Sweden's cultural heartland, skiing was simply part of life.

### Retirement Plans
Dahlqvist has indicated she's considering retiring after the **2027 Falun World Championships** — a potential farewell at home. This could make Milano Cortina one of her final Olympic opportunities.

## The Sprint World Cup Leader's Dilemma

### Always in the Final, Never on Top (in Classic)
Dahlqvist's 2025-26 classic sprint record tells a fascinating story: she has made the final in **all four classic sprints** this season — but finished 3rd, 4th, 4th, and 4th. She is the most consistent sprinter in the field, always in the mix, but the Tesero climb profile may further disadvantage her finishing-speed style compared to endurance-oriented sprinters.

Her 2021-22 season featured a similar 1,100+ day victory drought before she broke through at Cogne in February 2025 — showing she knows how to fight through dry spells.
