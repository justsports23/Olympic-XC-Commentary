## The Person Behind the Skis

### Family & Personal Life
Sundling is the **eldest of five siblings** — she has four younger brothers and sisters: **Vanessa, Lizette, Isak, and Tea-Lovelia**. Growing up in the Piteå area of northern Sweden, she was raised in communities where skis are practically a mode of daily transport.

Her **partner is Anton Olofsson**, and they have been together for over 8 years. She currently resides in Östersund.

Her parents, **Stefan and Marie Sundling**, raised all five children in a sporty, close-knit household. Being the eldest sibling of such a large family has shaped Sundling's calm, composed temperament — the very quality that makes her lethal in championship finals.

### Environmental Pioneer — "Green Trails"
Beyond racing, Sundling founded **Green Trails**, a program dedicated to recycling World Cup ski wax containers. She uses **biodegradable glide wax exclusively** and is deeply committed to sustainable living. Her environmental advocacy reflects a connection to the northern Swedish landscapes she grew up in — she races to protect the very nature she races through.

### Sweden's Sporting Darling
On **January 21, 2026** — three weeks before this Olympic sprint — Sundling won the **Jerring Award**, Sweden's most prestigious sports honor, chosen by public vote. She won it *"by a mile"*, cementing her status as the most beloved athlete in Sweden heading into Milano Cortina.

Rossignol celebrated her championship success by presenting her with **gold-painted skis** — a mark of just how dominant she's been. — [ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/jonna-sundling-got-new-gold-skis-in-france/)

## The Defending Champion's Quest

### Beijing 2022 — The Gold Standard
| Event | Technique | Result | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Individual Sprint | Freestyle | **GOLD** | Beat Dahlqvist by 2.88s |
| Team Sprint | Classic | **Silver** | With Dahlqvist; +0.20s behind Germany |
| 4×5km Relay | Mixed | **Bronze** | Anchored Swedish team |

### Three Consecutive World Sprint Titles
- **2021 Oberstdorf:** Gold (Classic Sprint)
- **2023 Planica:** Gold (Freestyle Sprint)
- **2025 Trondheim:** Gold (Freestyle Sprint)

No woman has ever won three consecutive World Championship sprint titles before Sundling. She's seeking to add Olympic gold #2 in Tesero.

### The Championship Peaker
Sundling's genius is her ability to **peak for the one race that matters most**. She selectively races the World Cup season, skipping events (including the entire Tour de Ski) to arrive at championships in optimal form. This strategy has produced 3 straight World sprint titles and an Olympic gold. She has said: *"Each and every year after the last Olympics have been getting stronger."* — [Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/jonna-sundling-darling-of-swedish-sport-exclusive-interview-winter-olympics)

She describes herself as *"a different Jonna"* now — stronger and faster than the woman who won gold in Beijing.

3. **The championship peaker:** Her entire season is built around peaking for this one race
4. **Age factor:** At 31, she insists she's faster than ever — but sprint racing favors youth
