## The Person Behind the Skis

### Finland's Rising Sprint Talent
U23 World Championship sprint gold medalist (2022-23). Made her **first WC sprint final** in December 2025, finishing 4th — narrowly missing the podium by the smallest of margins. Qualified 17th at Goms classic sprint.

Part of Finland's formidable four-woman sprint squad: Joensuu + Matintalo + Kahara + Saari. The Finnish sprint depth this season is the best it's been in years.

**Commentary Gold:** First WC sprint final in December — finished 4th, agonizingly close to the podium. Finland's sprint team is having its best season in a generation, and Kahara is a big reason why. U23 World Champion making her presence felt at the senior level.
