## The Person Behind the Skis

### Home Crowd Favorite — Racing for Val di Fiemme
Cassol is Italy's designated sprint specialist, and she's racing at the spiritual home of Italian cross-country skiing. **Tesero, Val di Fiemme** is where Italian XC legends were made — **Franco Nones**, from Val di Fiemme itself, won Italy's first-ever Olympic XC gold in 1968. Cassol carries the weight of that history.

### Family
- **Father:** Fiorenzo | **Mother:** Cristiana | **Older sister:** Martina
- Both parents introduced their daughters to the mountains from childhood. Cassol started at **Sci Club Sarre around age 6**, initially practicing downhill skiing.

### From Biathlon to Sprint Specialist
Cassol **tried biathlon** before choosing cross-country, explaining she preferred *"going as fast as possible, without the distractions of shooting at the range."* That pure-speed mentality defines her racing.

### Her Idol: Federico Pellegrino
Cassol's sporting hero is **Federico Pellegrino** — Italy's legendary sprint skier, Olympic and World Championship medalist. She's eager to follow in his footsteps on the Olympic stage. Pellegrino is competing in the men's sprint on the same day.

### Part of Italy's Record Olympic Delegation
Cassol is part of Italy's record **196-athlete Olympic delegation** — the largest ever for a host nation. The crowd at Tesero will be electric for her.
