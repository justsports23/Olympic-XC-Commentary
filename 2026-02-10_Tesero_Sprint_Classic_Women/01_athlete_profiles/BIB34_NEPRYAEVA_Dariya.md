## The Political Storyline

The most politically charged entry in the field. Younger sister of **Natalya Nepryaeva** (3x Beijing Olympic medalist). Russian athletes were banned from FIS competition since February 2022; in December 2025, CAS overturned FIS's ban, clearing Dariya for return. She made her WC return at Davos (December 13) — her first international competition in approximately three years. IOC cleared her for Olympic participation under strict neutrality criteria — **no flag, no anthem**.

**Season form:** 17th in Olympic skiathlon (Feb 7). 8th at Goms 20km classic. But in sprints: 25th at Goms, 39th at Davos. Sprint is not her discipline — she's a distance specialist.

**Commentary Gold:** Racing without flag or anthem. Her sister Natalya won 3 medals at Beijing 2022. The CAS ruling in December 2025 changed everything — from banned to Olympic athlete in less than three months. Sprint FIS points (75.48) suggest top-30 qualification is possible but not guaranteed.
