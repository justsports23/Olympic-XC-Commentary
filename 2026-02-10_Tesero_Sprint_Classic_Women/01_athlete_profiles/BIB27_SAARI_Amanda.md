# Amanda SAARI (FIN) 🇫🇮
**Bib:** 27 | **DOB:** ~2000 | **Nation:** Finland | **FIS Sprint Points:** 41.30
**Equipment:** Atomic

Finnish A-team member. Inconsistent qualifier but capable of brilliant classic sprint performances — qualified **5th at Trondheim's classic sprint** (very strong), but 32nd at Goms (did not qualify for heats). Her Trondheim 5th suggests serious potential on a good day. Fourth member of Finland's strong sprint squad (Joensuu, Matintalo, Kahara, Saari).

**Commentary Gold:** Her Trondheim 5th qualifier is the kind of result that shows she can mix it with the very best — on her day. The question is always: which Saari shows up?
