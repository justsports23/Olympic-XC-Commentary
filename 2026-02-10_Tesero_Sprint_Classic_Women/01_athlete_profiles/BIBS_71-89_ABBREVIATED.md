Beijing 2022 at age 17 — called up after teammate Moura's car crash. Brother **Cristian Ribera** was born with **arthrogryposis multiplex congenita** — doctors gave him "two hours to live."

Third brother **Fábio Ribera** coaches both siblings. Both Cristian (Paralympics) and Eduarda (Olympics) will compete at Milano Cortina 2026.

The most powerful sibling story in all of Olympic sport.
