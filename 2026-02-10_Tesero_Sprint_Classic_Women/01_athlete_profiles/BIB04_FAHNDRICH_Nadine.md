## The Person Behind the Skis

### A Skiing Family at the Foot of Mount Pilatus
Nadine grew up in **Eigenthal**, a district of Schwarzenberg in the canton of Lucerne — nestled at the foot of the iconic **Mount Pilatus** with a 15-kilometer trail literally at her doorstep. Both her parents, **Kurt and Käthy Fähndrich**, are deeply involved in cross-country skiing — with organizational and community roles in the sport — and had their daughter on skis from a young age. — [xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/) [Note: "started skiing at age 2" is UNVERIFIED; the parents' roles appear more organizational than competitive]

Her younger brother **Cyril Fähndrich** (born 1999) is also a professional cross-country skier. The two train together closely under private coach **Ivan Hudac**, who says of the sibling bond: *"The symbiosis is very strong."* Nadine agrees: *"We can benefit from this immensely."* — [xc-ski.de](https://www.xc-ski.de/events/langlauf-weltcup/portraits/international/faehndrich-nadine-sui-portrait/)

She joined **Skiclub Horw** at a young age and considers the club *"the foundation of everything"* — a lifelong connection to her local community.

### Heart Surgery — Racing Two Weeks Later
In **February 2024**, during a World Cup race in Canmore, Canada, heart rate monitor data revealed **cardiac arrhythmia** — extra heartbeats that had been detected during her junior years but were considered benign. After returning to Switzerland, stress testing led doctors to perform **heart surgery in March 2024**.

The remarkable part: **just two weeks after surgery**, Fähndrich returned to World Cup racing and finished fifth. After the procedure, the extra heartbeats became much less frequent, and symptoms like dizziness nearly disappeared. — [Sportlerin Magazin](https://www.sportlerin-magazin.ch/post/nadine-faehndrich)

### The Self-Described Classic Specialist
Fähndrich has spoken openly about her technique identity: *"This year I felt better in classic."* [UNVERIFIED — attributed in preview document; original source not located] She considers herself a **classic specialist** who has expanded to freestyle — the exact opposite of most modern sprint specialists. On the Tesero Olympic course, she reportedly said: *"The course is really fun to ski."* [UNVERIFIED — original source not located]

## The Classic Queen of Val di Fiemme

### Two Years, Two Podiums on the Olympic Course
Fähndrich has an extraordinary record at Val di Fiemme in classic sprints:
- **January 2025 (TdS):** Won the classic sprint — her first World Cup victory in nearly 3 years
- **January 2026 (TdS):** 2nd place, just 0.44 seconds behind Joensuu

No athlete in the field has a better two-year classic sprint record on this specific course.

She has described these Olympics as her opportunity to deliver her **"masterpiece"** — [SRF Sport](https://www.srf.ch/sport/milano-cortina-2026/langlauf-sprints-bei-olympia-wie-im-traum-faehndrich-will-unverhoffte-medaillen-chance-nutzen)
