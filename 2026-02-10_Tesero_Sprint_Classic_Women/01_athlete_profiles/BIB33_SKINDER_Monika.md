# Monika SKINDER (POL) 🇵🇱
**Bib:** 33 | **DOB:** ~2001 | **Nation:** Poland | **FIS Sprint Points:** 66.44
**Equipment:** Fischer

Polish XC skier. Ruka classic sprint qualifier: 30th (borderline). 38th at 2025 WC sprint qualification. Sprint WC overall: 38th. Borderline qualifier on a good day — the Tesero course's demands may push her just outside the top 30, but she'll fight for it.
