# Women's Team Sprint Free — Pairing Analysis for Broadcasters
## Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics | Tesero, 18 February 2026

---

## How to Use This Document

This is a team-by-team pairing analysis designed for live broadcast commentary. Each entry covers: the logic behind the pairing, what each athlete brings, the complementary dynamic, historical team sprint pedigree, and a broadcaster-ready storyline hook. Teams are ordered by medal probability.

**Format reminder:** Each team has two athletes. One skis Laps 1, 3, 5 (Red bib — Leg 1); the other skis Laps 2, 4, 6 (Blue bib — Leg 2/Anchor). Six laps total (~9.5 km), mass start final of 15 teams.

## TIER 1: GOLD FAVORITES

### BIB 02 — SWEDEN: Jonna Sundling (Red) / Maja Dahlqvist (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
This is the most proven team sprint partnership in women's cross-country skiing history. Sundling and Dahlqvist have won the World Championship team sprint together in three consecutive editions — [2021 Oberstdorf, 2023 Planica, and 2025 Trondheim](https://nordicinsights.news/2025/03/05/swedish-women-take-fourth-consecutive-team-sprint-gold-kern-and-diggins-claim-silver/) — in both classic and freestyle disciplines. They also won Olympic silver in Beijing 2022. No other active pairing has this depth of major championship team sprint results together.

**What Sundling Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- [23 World Cup wins](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/jonna-sundling), 7 World Championship golds — the most decorated active women's sprint skier
- Won [Sprint Free in Oberhof, December 2025](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/sundling-in-fine-form-as-she-eases-to-sprint-freestyle-win-in-oberhof) — peak free technique form
- [Olympic sprint classic silver at this exact venue](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/) on February 10
- Role: Sets the pace on Lap 1, maintains position on Laps 3 and 5, and delivers Dahlqvist into the anchor with minimal deficit

**What Dahlqvist Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- [14 World Cup wins](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/maja-dahlqvist), 2x Sprint World Cup overall champion, 3 World Championship team sprint golds
- Won [Tour de Ski Sprint Classic in Cogne, December 2025](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/dahlqvist-sprints-to-first-world-cup-victory-since-2021-it-was-win-or-die-) — form returned after a lean period
- [Olympic sprint classic bronze](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/) at Tesero on February 10
- Role: The closer. Dahlqvist's finishing speed in the final 300m of Lap 6 is the fastest in the field

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
Both are pure sprint specialists — this is not a distance/sprint mix but two elite sprinters who have refined their exchange timing and pacing communication over five years of racing together. Their [combined 106 World Cup podiums](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-womens-team-sprint/) represent an extraordinary depth of sprint experience. Their [Davos World Cup team sprint win in December 2025](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/solid-team-sprint-win-in-davos-for-sweden-s-world-champions) confirmed pre-Olympic cohesion.

**Championship Team Sprint Record Together:**
| Year | Event | Technique | Result |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 2021 | World Championships, Oberstdorf | Free | Gold |
| 2022 | Olympics, Beijing | Free | Silver |
| 2023 | World Championships, Planica | Free | Gold |
| 2025 | World Championships, Trondheim | Free | Gold |
| 2025 | World Championships, Trondheim | Classic | Gold |

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Sweden's Sundling and Dahlqvist are the Federer-Nadal of women's team sprint skiing — except they're on the same team. Three consecutive World titles together. The Swedish sprint sweep at the individual event eight days ago — gold, silver, bronze — was their nation's statement. Today is about confirming it in the team format they've owned for half a decade."*

## TIER 2: MEDAL CONTENDERS

### BIB 06 — GERMANY: Laura Gimmler (Red) / Coletta Rydzek (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Germany won the [most recent World Cup Team Sprint Free in Goms on January 23, 2026](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/gimmler-and-rydzek-boost-germany-s-olympic-hopes-with-goms-team-sprint-win) — beating Norway's Slind/Drivenes by 0.52 seconds. That Goms result is the single most directly relevant pre-Olympic predictor: same discipline, same format, same two athletes.

**What Gimmler Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- [8 World Cup podiums](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=134771); experienced relay campaigner with Germany's relay finishing 4th at these Olympics
- SC Oberstdorf-trained — same club as Rydzek; daily training partners
- Role: The reliable engine. Gimmler establishes Germany's position in the pack, keeps contact through Laps 1-5 without overextending

**What Rydzek Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- [Ranked 9th in sprint standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html); [8th in Olympic sprint classic final](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/41350) on February 10
- Won her [maiden World Cup in Sprint Free at Lahti, March 2025](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/rydzek-claims-maiden-world-cup-win-in-season-s-last-sprint) — FasterSkier described her as having ["the fastest skis in the field"](https://fasterskier.com/2025/03/coletta-rydzek-blazes-womens-sprint-in-lahti/)
- Role: Germany's weapon. Rydzek's explosive closing speed is their medal engine

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
This is a classic "steady Leg 1 / explosive Leg 2" construction. Gimmler absorbs the early pack chaos and maintains position; Rydzek deploys her sprint acceleration on the decisive final exchanges. They train together daily at SC Oberstdorf, giving them instinctive timing in the exchange zone. [FasterSkier called the Goms win](https://fasterskier.com/2026/01/goms-wasnt-the-answer-it-was-the-test/) "the test" they passed before the Olympics.

**Key Context:** Germany's 2022 Olympic team sprint gold was won by a *different* pairing — Victoria Carl and Katharina Hennig. Gimmler/Rydzek are not continuations of that team; they earned their credentials independently through Goms.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Remember — Germany are the defending Olympic team sprint champions from Beijing. Different athletes, same DNA. Gimmler and Rydzek won the last test event before the Games in Goms. They beat Norway by half a second. The question today: can they do it again when it counts for gold?"*

### BIB 01 — NORWAY: Astrid Oyre Slind (Red) / Julie Bjervig Drivenes (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Norway deploys a distance/sprint hybrid: the 38-year-old Slind is fundamentally a distance skier ([Vasaloppet women's course record holder in 3:50:06.4](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/she-almost-retired-at-26-now-at-her-first-olympics-astrid-oyre-slind-has-a-gold-medal-at-age-38/)), while 26-year-old Drivenes is an emerging sprint specialist. They [finished 2nd at the Goms World Cup Team Sprint Free on January 23](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/gimmler-and-rydzek-boost-germany-s-olympic-hopes-with-goms-team-sprint-win), establishing their Olympic pairing credentials.

**What Slind Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- Age 38 — the oldest athlete in any medal-contending team sprint pairing at these Games
- [Won Olympic relay gold at this venue on February 14](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/norway-powers-to-4x7-5km-relay-gold-at-milano-cortina-2026/) — just four days earlier
- [Won Tour de Ski Stage 2 in Toblach, December 29](https://all-things-nordic.com/2025/12/30/fis-cross-country-skiing-world-cup-2025-26-toblach-tour-de-ski-stage-2-astrid-slind-norway-wins-womens-interval-start-classic/)
- 21 World Cup podiums including 5 wins; exceptional climbing ability
- Role: Uses superior aerobic capacity to hold pace on the Tesero climbs where pure sprinters may fade on Lap 3 and Lap 5

**What Drivenes Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- [4th in Olympic sprint classic final on February 10](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/) — beaten only by the three Swedish sprinters
- Won a [skate sprint in Beitostolen, November 2025](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-beitostolen-julie-bjervig-drivenes-wins-by-a-whisker-ahead-of-karoline-simpson-larsen-in-the-individual-skate-delphine-claudel-fifteenth-1123/)
- Role: Norway's sprint finisher. Her 4th-place Olympic sprint proves she belongs in the final-lap fight

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
The age gap is the story: Slind at 38 brings the experience of someone who [almost retired at 26](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/she-almost-retired-at-26-now-at-her-first-olympics-astrid-oyre-slind-has-a-gold-medal-at-age-38/) and is now racing in her first Olympics with a gold medal already in her pocket. Drivenes at 26 brings the explosive speed Norway needs to compete with Dahlqvist and Rydzek on the final lap. This pairing is unconventional — most medal contenders pair two sprinters — but Norway's philosophy is that Slind's distance endurance on the repeated climbs will actually *gain* time on Laps 3 and 5 where sprint specialists fatigue.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Astrid Slind is 38 years old. She almost quit the sport at 26. She won Olympic relay gold at this stadium four days ago. Now she's paired with 26-year-old Julie Drivenes — a full generation apart. Slind's job is to climb; Drivenes' job is to sprint. Norway is betting that endurance plus youth equals a medal."*

---

### BIB 04 — SWITZERLAND: Nadja Kalin (Red) / Nadine Fahndrich (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Switzerland deploys the same distance/sprint architecture as Norway but with an even more extreme gap between the two athletes' sprint rankings. Kalin (ranked [41st in sprint standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html)) is fundamentally a skiathlon/distance specialist; Fahndrich (7 World Cup wins, [World Championship sprint free bronze](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162603&type=result)) is a legitimate world-class sprinter. The bet: Kalin keeps contact, Fahndrich closes.

**What Kalin Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- [4th in the Olympic skiathlon at this venue on February 7](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-switzerland-dazzled-by-nadja-kaelins-fourth-place-in-the-skiathlon-0207/) — Swiss media called the country "dazzled"
- Trains at altitude in [St. Moritz (~1,800m)](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/index/nadja-kaelin-is-switzerlands-greatest-hope-in-the-skiathlon-3084952.html) — Tesero's 900m is well within her comfort zone
- Junior World Championship gold in distance events
- Role: Maintain pack contact on her three laps. She doesn't need to gain time — she needs to not lose it

**What Fahndrich Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- [Won the Tour de Ski Sprint Classic at this venue on January 6, 2026](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-val-di-fiemme-nadine-faehndrich-finds-her-way-back-to-victory-in-the-classic-sprint-of-the-tour-de-ski-0103/)
- [Finished 2nd at the same venue on January 3](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-val-di-fiemme-nadine-faehndrich-finds-her-way-back-to-victory-in-the-classic-sprint-of-the-tour-de-ski-0103/)
- [7 career World Cup wins](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162603&type=result) across both techniques; 3-time Olympian
- [2021 World Championship Team Sprint silver](https://fasterskier.com/2021/02/swedens-sundling-edges-out-switzerland-for-team-sprint-gold-usa-5th/) with van der Graaff — she's been to the podium in this exact format before
- Role: The venue specialist. No other athlete in the field has won at this course more recently

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
The risk is clear: if Kalin loses contact on Lap 1 or Lap 3, Fahndrich inherits a gap she cannot close alone. The opportunity is equally clear: if Kalin uses her skiathlon fitness to maintain position, Fahndrich has proven she can win from the front group on this specific course. The pairing's Goms result is [DATA NOT FOUND], leaving a gap in direct comparison data.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Here's the Swiss strategy in one sentence: Nadine Fahndrich won on this exact course six weeks ago. That's a fact no other anchor in this final can claim. The question is whether her partner Nadja Kalin — a distance skier, not a sprinter — can keep Switzerland in the race long enough for Fahndrich to use that venue knowledge."*

---

### BIB 03 — USA: Jessie Diggins (Red) / Julia Kern (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
This is the field's most championship-tested pairing after Sundling/Dahlqvist. Diggins and Kern have raced together at [four consecutive World Championship team sprints](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/athletes/julia-kern) (2021 silver, 2023 bronze, 2025 silver in free; 2025 silver in classic). Their combined championship record is unmatched by any non-Swedish team.

**What Diggins Brings (Leg 1 — Laps 1, 3, 5):**
- [29 World Cup wins](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/jessie-diggins), [3x Tour de Ski champion](https://snowbrains.com/u-s-cross-country-skier-jessie-diggins-wins-tour-de-ski-for-the-3rd-time/), [2018 Olympic team sprint gold (with Kikkan Randall)](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/jessie-diggins-meet-athlete)
- [Won Olympic bronze in 10km free at this venue on February 8](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/diggins-wins-fourth-olympic-medal-bronze-10k-skate) — she has medaled at Tesero in 2026
- [Won the 2013 World Championship Team Sprint at this exact venue](https://fasterskier.com/2013/02/unreal-randall-and-diggins-are-world-champions/) with Kikkan Randall — the USA's first-ever Worlds gold in XC skiing
- Managing [bruised ribs from a skiathlon crash](https://www.powder.com/news/jessie-diggins-skier-milan-cortina-2026)
- [Retiring after this season](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/one-final-season-jessie-diggins-announces-retirement-following-end-2025-26-season) — this is her final Olympic race

**What Kern Brings (Leg 2/Anchor — Laps 2, 4, 6):**
- [6th in Olympic sprint classic final on February 10](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/berkeley-julia-kern-cross-country-sprint/4031977/) — her best individual Olympic sprint result
- [World Championship bronze in team sprint free with Diggins (2023)](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/athletes/julia-kern); [World Championship silver in team sprint classic (2025)](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/athletes/julia-kern)
- Role: Sprint closer. Kern has improved her sprint finishing speed dramatically over the past two seasons

**The Complementary Dynamic:**
Diggins provides something almost no other Leg 1 athlete can: world-class distance endurance *combined* with elite sprint competency. She's a Tour de Ski champion who can also win sprint races. Kern provides finishing speed. The pairing's four-championship continuity means they have rehearsed every scenario — lead changes, pack sprints, late charges, defensive skiing.

**Key Concern:** Diggins' bruised ribs. Three hard skating laps at sprint intensity will test her pain tolerance. She has already raced a 10km individual event, a relay leg, and a skiathlon at these Games. Cumulative fatigue is the most realistic threat to USA's medal chances.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Jessie Diggins won her first World Championship gold medal on this exact course in 2013 — losing a pole on the final climb and powering through with one arm. Thirteen years later, she returns to the same stadium for her final Olympic race. She's managing bruised ribs. She's already won bronze at this venue this week. Today with Julia Kern — four World Championship team sprints together — they chase one more medal to close the greatest American XC career in history."*

## TIER 3: DARK HORSES

### BIB 05 — FINLAND: Jasmi Joensuu (Red) / Jasmin Kahara (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Finland's construction mirrors a sprint-sprint pairing but with a venue-specific edge: Joensuu [won the Tour de Ski Sprint Classic at this exact Olympic venue on January 3](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/joensuu-claims-perfect-first-world-cup-win-on-olympic-course) and [anchored Finland to relay bronze four days ago on February 14](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/themes/themes/sports/28518-finland-claim-relay-bronze-at-milan-cortina.html).

**What Joensuu Brings:** [2024-25 Sprint World Cup overall champion](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=184356); won on this course six weeks ago; relay bronze momentum. The critical caveat: her venue wins were in classic technique, not freestyle.

**What Kahara Brings:** Ranked [17th in sprint standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html); [U23 World Championship Sprint Classic gold (2023)](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/jasmin-kahara-wins-the-sprint-race-at-the-u23-world-championships/). Emerging talent, not yet a World Cup winner.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Jasmi Joensuu won the last sprint race at this venue. She anchored Finland's relay to bronze on this course three days ago. She's the reigning Sprint World Cup champion. Finland are not a dark horse — they're seeded 5th. The question is whether the free technique format suits Joensuu as well as her classic victories suggest."*

---

### BIB 10 — CZECH REPUBLIC: Sandra Schuetzova (Red) / Katerina Janatova (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Janatova is the most in-form all-rounder at this venue: she [finished 7th in the Olympic Skiathlon at Tesero on February 7](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-imperial-frida-karlsson-triumphs-in-the-skiathlon-leonie-perry-16th-0207/), and Czech Republic [finished 7th at the 2023 Worlds team sprint free in Planica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate%C5%99ina_Janatov%C3%A1). The concern is Schuetzova's limited freestyle sprint credentials.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Janatova finished 7th in the Olympic skiathlon on this course eleven days ago. She knows exactly how the terrain drains your legs on repeated climbs. If the pack stays together into the final laps — which is common in women's team sprints — Janatova has the fitness to be there."*

---

### BIB 07 — ITALY: Caterina Ganz (Red) / Iris De Martin Pinter (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
Home snow. 15,000 spectators at Tesero. De Martin Pinter [finished 6th in the Sprint Free World Cup in Oberhof](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=245052) — Italy's first woman in a sprint final in over five years. Ganz (ranked 43rd in sprint) is the limitation.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Listen to the crowd. Fifteen thousand Italian fans. Italy hasn't had a women's sprint finalist in five years — then Iris De Martin Pinter finished 6th at Oberhof. Can the home crowd lift Ganz through her laps and deliver De Martin Pinter a chance?"*

---

### BIB 25 — CROATIA: Tena Hadzic (Red) / Ema Sobol (Blue)

**The Pairing Logic:**
The field's biggest seeding anomaly. Hadzic is [ranked approximately 7th-8th in World Cup sprint standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html) but starts at Bib 25 because partner Sobol (born December 2007, age 18) has essentially no World Cup points. Croatia likely needs an extraordinary qualification round just to make the final.

**Broadcaster Hook:** *"Tena Hadzic is ranked in the world's top 8 sprinters. She's starting 25th out of 26 teams because her partner is 18 years old. If they qualify — and that's a big if — Hadzic becomes genuinely dangerous in the mass start final."*

## HEAD-TO-HEAD MATCHUP MAP

**The Gold Fight:**
- SWE vs. GER — Sweden did not race Goms; Germany won it. No 2025-26 direct comparison exists. Historical edge: Sweden has won every major championship team sprint since 2021. [2022 Beijing was the exception: GER (Carl/Hennig) beat SWE for gold.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-country_skiing_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women's_team_sprint)

**The Silver Fight:**
- GER vs. NOR — Germany beat Norway [by 0.52 in Goms](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/gimmler-and-rydzek-boost-germany-s-olympic-hopes-with-goms-team-sprint-win). This is the tightest direct comparison in the field.
- NOR vs. SUI — Unknown. Goms result for Switzerland [DATA NOT FOUND].

**The Bronze Fight:**
- USA vs. SUI vs. FIN — Three teams with realistic bronze ambitions. USA has the deeper championship record (4 Worlds team sprint medals with Diggins/Kern). SUI has the venue advantage (Fahndrich won here). FIN has the Sprint World Cup champion (Joensuu).

**The Upset Scenario:**
- If the final becomes a tight pack sprint (most likely outcome per [historical pattern](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-womens-team-sprint/)), ANY team in the top 8 could reach the podium. The decisive moment is typically the first 300m of Lap 5 — the second-to-last lap — where a breakaway attempt forces the field to respond or concede.
