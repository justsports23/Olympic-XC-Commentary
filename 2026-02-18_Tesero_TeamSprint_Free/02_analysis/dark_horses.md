# Dark Horses — Women's Team Sprint Free
## Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics | Tesero, 18 February 2026

## What It Takes to Be a Dark Horse Here

The team sprint final is a mass start of 15 teams across 6 laps. The pack dynamic creates the potential for surprises unavailable in interval start events: a team does not need to be the fastest — it needs to be fast enough to survive until the final lap, then deliver one explosive exchange at the right moment. Course familiarity, clean execution in the tag zone, and a partner who peaks on the right day can outweigh modest sprint rankings on paper.

The three teams below have specific, concrete reasons why they could disrupt the top-five order.

## Dark Horse 1: Czech Republic — Sandra Schuetzova / Katerina Janatova (BIB 10)

**The case: Janatova is the most in-form all-rounder at this venue; 7th at 2023 Worlds in this exact event.**

Katerina Janatova arrived at these Olympics in the form of her life. On February 7, she [finished 7th in the Olympic Skiathlon at Tesero](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-imperial-frida-karlsson-triumphs-in-the-skiathlon-leonie-perry-16th-0207/) — ahead of Jessie Diggins, who was struggling with bruised ribs. That result is highly relevant: the Tesero skiathlon course uses the same loops and terrain as the team sprint course. Janatova finished 7th at a major championship event on this specific course just eleven days before the team sprint. She knows how the terrain drains legs on repeated climbs, and she clearly has the fitness to be competitive with the top ten in the field right now.

Her historical team sprint record is equally notable. At the [2023 Planica World Championships, the Czech team finished 7th in the Women's Team Sprint Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate%C5%99ina_Janatov%C3%A1) — the same discipline and format as this Olympic event. That result places them in the bracket of teams capable of a top-8 finish, and in a compressed mass start final, a top-8 team can find the right gap to the podium.

Schuetzova brings veteran stability to Leg 1. A 34-year-old veteran with five World Championship appearances ([FIS profile — Schuetzova](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=122277)), she has experienced every scenario in high-stakes competition. She is not a sprint specialist — her primary strength is classic distance technique — but in a team sprint, her role is to maintain position and not lose time, allowing Janatova (the faster closer) to do damage on the later exchanges. Their [relay finished 11th at these Olympics on February 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics), demonstrating they can execute relay-format races at the Olympic level.

**The specific scenario:** If the pack stays together through laps 1–4 (which is common in women's team sprint finals), Janatova lines up for Leg 5 or the closing Leg 6 within striking distance of the leaders. Her all-around fitness and current form on this course make her capable of a top-5 or even podium finish if the pieces align.

**The limitation:** Schuetzova's moderate freestyle sprint credentials are the weak link. If she loses significant time on her legs, Janatova cannot single-handedly recover it. The Czech Republic also lacks a recent World Cup team sprint win that would validate medal-level team sprint chemistry.

## Dark Horse 2: Finland — Jasmi Joensuu / Jasmin Kähärä (BIB 05)

**The case: Joensuu won a sprint race at this exact Olympic venue six weeks ago; Finland anchored the relay to bronze four days ago.**

Jasmi Joensuu has perhaps the most explosively relevant venue form of any athlete in the field outside of Fähndrich. On January 3, 2026, she [won the Tour de Ski Sprint Classic at Val di Fiemme](https://all-things-nordic.com/2026/01/03/fis-cross-country-skiing-world-cup-2025-26-val-di-fiemme-tour-de-ski-stage-5-jasmin-joensuu-finland-wins-womens-sprint-final-classic/), the Olympic venue, describing it as a ["perfect" first World Cup win on the Olympic course](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/joensuu-claims-perfect-first-world-cup-win-on-olympic-course). She had also won the Tour de Ski Sprint Classic stage in Toblach weeks earlier [NEEDS VERIFICATION — the available Toblach source references Slind's 10km Classic win, not Joensuu's sprint stage; confirm via [FIS results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/results.html)]. These are both classic technique wins, but Joensuu is a [Sprint World Cup overall champion (2024-25)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=184356) with wins in both techniques across her career — her sprint speed translates to free technique as well. She [anchored Finland to the relay bronze at this venue on February 14](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/themes/themes/sports/28518-finland-claim-relay-bronze-at-milan-cortina.html) — she finished the relay under pressure, holding off the chase pack, four days before this event.

Kähärä is Finland's emerging sprint talent, ranked [17th in sprint standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html) in the 2025-26 season. She won the [U23 World Championship Sprint Classic in 2023](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/jasmin-kahara-wins-the-sprint-race-at-the-u23-world-championships/) — a significant title suggesting she knows how to perform under championship pressure. At the Olympics she competed in the sprint classic, and the pair [raced together in the Goms World Cup Team Sprint in January 2026](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html), building team sprint chemistry before the Olympics.

**The specific scenario:** Finland qualified toward the front (Bib 05), meaning their combined sprint points rank them fifth in the field — they are not dark horses by conventional seeding. What makes them a surprise candidate for gold or silver (rather than merely "expected top-5") is the concentration of Joensuu's venue-specific form. A skier who won this exact sprint loop six weeks ago and anchored a relay bronze four days ago is in peak form at exactly the right moment. If Kähärä holds position during her legs, Joensuu is explosive enough to win the race outright.

**The limitation:** The team sprint free (skating) is not Joensuu's strongest technique — her Tour de Ski wins at this venue were in classic. She has demonstrated free technique team sprint capability (Finland won a World Cup team sprint in 2024-25 — [FIS: Finland finish first in Team Sprint](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/finland-finish-first-in-team-sprint-as-niskanen-and-joensuu-end-12-year-wait-for-win)), but the question mark is whether her skating output over three laps matches her classic explosiveness. Kähärä has not yet won a senior World Cup individual sprint — her form places her in the top-20 tier rather than podium contention on individual starts.

## Dark Horse 3: Croatia — Tena Hadzic / Ema Sobol (BIB 25)

**The case: Hadzic is ranked in the top 8 of the World Cup sprint standings — dramatically underseeded at Bib 25.**

This is the field's biggest seeding anomaly. Tena Hadzic is [ranked approximately 7th–8th in the 2025-26 World Cup sprint standings with approximately 204 sprint points and 430 overall points](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html). Yet Croatia was assigned Bib 25 — next to last in the field. This discrepancy is likely because team sprint bib seeding uses combined FIS points for both athletes, and partner Ema Sobol (born December 2007, age 18 — [FIS profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=275954&type=result)) is a near-debutante with essentially no World Cup sprint points. The pairing's combined ranking therefore places them at the back — despite Hadzic individually being one of the ten best sprint skiers in the field.

Hadzic is a two-time Olympian who [carried the Croatian flag at the Beijing 2022 closing ceremony](https://total-croatia-news.com/news/sport/tena-hadzic/) and will carry it at the [2026 closing ceremony](https://total-croatia-news.com/news/sport/tena-hadzic/) — a distinction reflecting her status as Croatia's most prominent winter athlete. She has raced at three World Championships ([FIS profile — Hadzic](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=238379)). Her individual sprint World Cup ranking in the top 10 gives her the raw speed to compete for qualification from the back of the bib order.

**The specific scenario:** In qualification (interval start, 30-second gaps), Hadzic needs to post a fast combined two-lap time. Starting last means later conditions may have slightly more worn tracks, but this is a secondary factor. The primary question is whether she can carry Sobol's weaker leg into the top 15 for the final. If they qualify — and Hadzic's individual form says they should — she becomes genuinely dangerous in the mass-start final where bib order is irrelevant. Her 7th-place ranking translates directly to potential explosive performances in the six-lap final.

**The limitation:** Sobol is 18 years old with one World Championship appearance ([67th in the 2025 Worlds Sprint Free](https://www.portal.hr/en/novosti/sport-hr/104914-zoi-u-utorak-prvi-hrvatski-nastupi-u-brzom-klizanju-skijaskom-trcanju-i-biatlonu)) and [did not advance past the sprint qualifier](https://www.portal.hr/en/novosti/sport-hr/104925-zoi-hadzic-i-sobol-nisu-prosle-kvalifikacije) at these Olympics individually. Their combined qualifying time will be pulled significantly lower by Sobol's leg. The most likely outcome is that Croatia does not advance through qualification at all. Even if they do, Sobol's three laps in the final would need to maintain contact with the field — a very tall order against World Cup athletes three to six years her senior.

**Verdict:** The most realistic scenario is non-qualification. But if Hadzic has an extraordinary day and Sobol exceeds expectations, this team should not be ignored in the final. The sprint speed is there on one side of the exchange; the question is purely whether the other leg can keep pace.

## Honorable Mention: Latvia — Kitija Auzina / Patricija Eiduka (BIB 15)

Eiduka [finished 15th in the Olympic 10km Free at Tesero on February 12](https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/sport/12.02.2026-patricija-eiduka-sets-latvian-record-in-olympic-cross-country.a634374/) — Latvia's best-ever individual Olympic result in cross-country skiing. She has [two career top-5 World Cup results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=195909), is the [U23 green bib winner from 2023-24](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/last-seasons-u-23-winner-patricija-eiduka), and is in the best form of her career at this venue. Like the Czech pairing, the limitation is the distance-focused profile of both athletes (Auzina [finished 61st in the skiathlon](https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/sport/08.02.2026-eiduka-finishes-23rd-in-olympic-skiathlon-opmanis-32nd-in-downhill.a633615/)) and a lack of recent World Cup team sprint wins to validate team-specific chemistry. A top-10 in the final would be a major achievement; a medal push is a further stretch.

## Honorable Mention: Italy — Caterina Ganz / Iris De Martin Pinter (BIB 07)

Italy races on home snow with a 15,000-person stadium crowd, which is a factor. [De Martin Pinter finished 6th in the Sprint Free World Cup final in Oberhof in January 2026](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=245052) — the first time Italy had placed a woman in a sprint final for over five years. The pair know the Tesero venue as a home course. The limiting factor is Ganz's modest sprint standings (43rd — [FIS Cup Standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html)) — if she cannot maintain pack contact, De Martin Pinter's closing speed never gets the chance to show itself. A home-crowd inspired top-8 is possible.
