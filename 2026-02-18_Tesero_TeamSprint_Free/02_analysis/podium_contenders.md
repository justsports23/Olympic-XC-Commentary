# Podium Contenders — Women's Team Sprint Free
## Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics | Tesero, 18 February 2026

---

## Overview

Five teams stand out as genuine medal contenders for the Women's Team Sprint Free. The event is a 9.5 km free-technique relay across 6 laps (3 per athlete), with the final run as a mass start between 15 qualified teams. This format rewards teams that combine individual sprint speed with aerobic endurance — a pairing that separates great teams from merely fast ones.

## 1. Sweden — Jonna Sundling / Maja Dahlqvist (BIB 02)

**Verdict: Overwhelming favorites. Gold is theirs to lose.**

**Current Form**
Sundling and Dahlqvist are the two most decorated women's sprint skiers in the world — and they have been executing at that level all season. Sundling won the [Sprint Free World Cup in Oberhof](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/sundling-in-fine-form-as-she-eases-to-sprint-freestyle-win-in-oberhof) in December 2025. Dahlqvist won the [Tour de Ski Sprint Classic stage in Cogne](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/dahlqvist-sprints-to-first-world-cup-victory-since-2021-it-was-win-or-die-) in December 2025 — her first win in years and a signal that her form had fully returned. At the Olympic individual sprint classic on February 10, Sweden swept all three medals: Linn Svahn gold, Sundling silver, Dahlqvist bronze. That [historic Swedish sprint sweep](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/) — the fourth time Sweden won an Olympic triple in any event — affirmed they are the form nation. Sundling holds [FIS Sprint Points of 416](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html); Dahlqvist is ranked 16th overall in sprint standings with 395 points and 20th overall with 855 World Cup points.

**Freestyle Technique Fit**
Both athletes are elite freestyle sprint performers. Sundling won the [2023 World Championship Sprint Free](https://swedenherald.com/article/sundling-wins-third-consecutive-world-championship-gold) and the [2025 World Championship Sprint Free](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/jonna-sundling-darling-of-swedish-sport-exclusive-interview-winter-olympics), demonstrating dominance in this exact technique. Dahlqvist has [three World Championship gold medals in the team sprint free](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/maja-dahlqvist) (2021, 2023, 2025). This is arguably their strongest possible discipline — free technique team sprint.

**Course Profile Fit**
The Tesero sprint loop is a repeated punishing course that favors explosive V2 power combined with aerobic capacity. Both athletes are pure sprint specialists who have spent years refining their skating technique. Their combined 106 World Cup podiums [NEEDS VERIFICATION] represent extraordinary depth across all sprint scenarios. The course demands three hard laps per athlete — exactly the multi-lap endurance profile that separates them from one-lap sprinters.

**Venue History**
Sundling finished [silver in the Olympic Sprint Classic at this exact venue](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/) on February 10, and Dahlqvist earned bronze. Both athletes also raced the Tour de Ski sprint stages here in January 2026 and January 2025 ([FIS — Tour de Ski](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/cross-country/cross-country-news-multimedia/news/archive/article=val-fiemme-tour-ski)). No team in this field has more competitive laps on the Olympic course.

**Team Chemistry**
Sundling and Dahlqvist have raced together in the team sprint since at least 2021. They have won the World Championship team sprint — in both classic and free technique — in three consecutive editions (2021, 2023, 2025). Their tagzone execution, tactical decision-making under pressure, and ability to read each other's effort levels are the product of years of partnership. The [FIS team sprint win in Davos in the 2025-26 season](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/solid-team-sprint-win-in-davos-for-sweden-s-world-champions) further confirmed their cohesion. Their [Beijing 2022 Olympic silver](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/maja-dahlqvist) gives them specific Olympic team sprint experience.

**Risk Factors**
The only realistic risk is equipment/wax malfunction, an injury mid-race, or an extraordinary performance from a rival. They are otherwise the clear gold-medal standard for this event.

## 2. Germany — Laura Gimmler / Coletta Rydzek (BIB 06)

**Verdict: Silver contenders. Won the last major team sprint test before the Olympics.**

**Current Form**
Germany's decisive statement came on January 23, 2026, when Gimmler and Rydzek [won the World Cup Team Sprint Free in Goms, Switzerland](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/gimmler-and-rydzek-boost-germany-s-olympic-hopes-with-goms-team-sprint-win) — beating Norway (Slind/Drivenes) into second place by 0:52. That result was the most direct pre-Olympic predictor for this event: same discipline, same format, same two athletes, same approximate conditions. Rydzek is ranked [9th in sprint standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html) and finished [8th in the Olympic sprint classic final](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/41350) on February 10. Gimmler is ranked [26th overall with 436 World Cup points](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html). Germany's relay finished 4th at the Olympics on February 14 ([Olympics.com — relay results](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/41350)).

**Freestyle Technique Fit**
Rydzek won her [maiden World Cup in Sprint Free in Lahti in March 2025](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/rydzek-claims-maiden-world-cup-win-in-season-s-last-sprint) — [FasterSkier described her performance](https://fasterskier.com/2025/03/coletta-rydzek-blazes-womens-sprint-in-lahti/) as having "the fastest skis in the field." Gimmler has built her career on strong freestyle sprint relay performances, representing SC Oberstdorf where both athletes train. Their Goms win was in the free technique — the exact discipline of this event ([FIS — Goms win](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/gimmler-and-rydzek-boost-germany-s-olympic-hopes-with-goms-team-sprint-win)).

**Course Profile Fit**
Rydzek is characterized by explosive finishing speed. The Tesero course's repeated hard climbs may test the limits of her anaerobic output across three laps, but her World Cup form suggests she handles multi-lap sprint finals well. Gimmler provides reliable, consistent effort across her laps — a different but complementary engine.

**Venue History**
Rydzek [competed in the Olympic sprint classic final at this venue](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/41350) on February 10, finishing 8th. Gimmler [competed in the relay at Tesero](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/41350) on February 14. Neither has specifically won at this venue, but Rydzek's sprint final appearance gives her lap-by-lap familiarity.

**Team Chemistry**
Gimmler and Rydzek are both from SC Oberstdorf — they train together daily ([FIS — Coletta Rydzek video](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/video/2026-01/coletta-rydzek-bavarian-export-nordic-skier-and-secret-alpine-gossip-broker-134368429943613)). Their Goms win demonstrated a partnership that knows how to race as a unit, manage tagging pressure, and execute when the race is on the line. [FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/01/goms-wasnt-the-answer-it-was-the-test/) called it "the test" they passed before the Olympics.

**Risk Factors**
Sweden is clearly faster on paper. Germany's path to gold requires either a Swedish miscue (fall, wax failure, mechanical) or a near-perfect race. A silver medal would require Germany to out-sprint NOR or SUI on the final exchange — which Rydzek's form absolutely suggests is possible.

## 3. Norway — Astrid Øyre Slind / Julie Bjervig Drivenes (BIB 01)

**Verdict: Silver or bronze. The pairing that finished 2nd in Goms; now racing on home medal momentum.**

**Current Form**
Slind won the [Tour de Ski Stage 2 in Toblach](https://all-things-nordic.com/2025/12/30/fis-cross-country-skiing-world-cup-2025-26-toblach-tour-de-ski-stage-2-astrid-slind-norway-wins-womens-interval-start-classic/) (10km Classic, Dec 29, 2025) and is one of Norway's premier distance skiers. Critically, she [won gold in the Olympic relay on February 14](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/norway-powers-to-4x7-5km-relay-gold-at-milano-cortina-2026/) — arriving at the team sprint with an Olympic gold medal already in her pocket and full confidence. Drivenes [finished 4th in the Olympic sprint classic final](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/) — matching that the only reason she doesn't have an individual Olympic medal is the extraordinary depth of Swedish sprint talent. Together, Slind and Drivenes [finished 2nd at the World Cup Team Sprint Free in Goms on January 23](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/gimmler-and-rydzek-boost-germany-s-olympic-hopes-with-goms-team-sprint-win), behind Germany.

**Freestyle Technique Fit**
Drivenes is fundamentally a freestyle sprint specialist — she won a [skate sprint race in Beitostølen in November 2025](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-beitostolen-julie-bjervig-drivenes-wins-by-a-whisker-ahead-of-karoline-simpson-larsen-in-the-individual-skate-delphine-claudel-fifteenth-1123/) and her 4th-place Olympic sprint classic result demonstrates she competes at the highest level in freestyle sprint finals. Slind has [World Cup freestyle victories](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/slind-tames-tricky-toblach-track-to-win-10km-classic) including a 20km freestyle win in Toblach (Dec 31, 2024) — she is not a pure distance specialist but a true all-rounder who executes in free technique.

**Course Profile Fit**
Slind's exceptional climbing ability (she holds the [Vasaloppet women's course record in 3:50:06.4](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/she-almost-retired-at-26-now-at-her-first-olympics-astrid-oyre-slind-has-a-gold-medal-at-age-38/)) makes her one of the best climbers in the field. On a course with repeated difficult climbs, her ability to carry pace over altitude changes without degradation is a major structural advantage. Drivenes handles the sprint speed and recovery. The combination is well-matched to this course.

**Venue History**
Drivenes [competed in the Olympic sprint classic at this exact venue](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/) on February 10 and was 4th in the final — she knows the course intimately. Slind [won the Olympic relay here](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/norway-powers-to-4x7-5km-relay-gold-at-milano-cortina-2026/) on February 14. Norway as a nation has won more medals at this venue (Tour de Ski, World Championships, Olympics) than almost any other country.

**Team Chemistry**
At age 38 ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/she-almost-retired-at-26-now-at-her-first-olympics-astrid-oyre-slind-has-a-gold-medal-at-age-38/)), Slind brings veteran leadership and pacing intelligence. At 26, Drivenes brings explosive energy and sprint instinct. Their [Goms partnership](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/gimmler-and-rydzek-boost-germany-s-olympic-hopes-with-goms-team-sprint-win) — Norway's established team sprint pairing for this season — was forged under race pressure just weeks before the Olympics. Norway typically executes well in team events under pressure.

**Risk Factors**
Germany beat them in Goms and may repeat. Slind is 38 years old, which raises fatigue questions across a three-lap effort in free technique for a primary distance specialist. However, she completed the relay just four days earlier at a high level.

## 4. Switzerland — Nadja Kälin / Nadine Fähndrich (BIB 04)

**Verdict: Bronze contenders. Fähndrich won at this venue six weeks ago; Kälin is riding 4th-place Olympic skiathlon momentum.**

**Current Form**
Fähndrich's venue form is the most directly relevant data point in this entire field: she [won the Tour de Ski Sprint Classic at Val di Fiemme on January 6, 2026](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-val-di-fiemme-nadine-faehndrich-finds-her-way-back-to-victory-in-the-classic-sprint-of-the-tour-de-ski-0103/), and [finished second at the same venue two days earlier on January 3](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-val-di-fiemme-nadine-faehndrich-finds-her-way-back-to-victory-in-the-classic-sprint-of-the-tour-de-ski-0103/). She also placed [3rd in the Sprint Free World Cup in Davos](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/faehndrich-wins-sprint-on-olympic-tracks-as-klaebo-extends-tour-lead) in December 2025. Fähndrich is Switzerland's sprint closer — [7 career World Cup wins across both techniques](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162603&type=result). Kälin [finished 4th in the Olympic skiathlon at Tesero](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-switzerland-dazzled-by-nadja-kaelins-fourth-place-in-the-skiathlon-0207/) on February 7 — Swiss media described the country as "dazzled" by the result. She carries fresh Olympic venue confidence into the team sprint.

**Freestyle Technique Fit**
Fähndrich has [World Championship bronze in Sprint Free (2025 Trondheim)](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162603&type=result) and World Cup wins in sprint free — she is a legitimate world-class free technique sprinter. Kälin's strength is in skiathlon and interval start formats, but completing the free-technique portion of a skiathlon at Olympic level demonstrates solid skating mechanics.

**Course Profile Fit**
Fähndrich has won at this specific course using the sprint loop. That is as good as course fit evidence gets. Kälin is an [altitude-trained athlete from St. Moritz](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/index/nadja-kaelin-is-switzerlands-greatest-hope-in-the-skiathlon-3084952.html) who excels on climbing courses — Tesero's repeated climbs are aligned with her preparation environment.

**Venue History**
Fähndrich won here January 6, finished 2nd here January 3. No other athlete in the field has a more recent venue win. Kälin [raced the Olympic skiathlon here on February 7](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-switzerland-dazzled-by-nadja-kaelins-fourth-place-in-the-skiathlon-0207/) and finished 4th. Combined, Switzerland has as much or more recent course experience at this venue as any contender.

**Team Chemistry**
Kälin (distance engine, Leg 1/3/5) and Fähndrich (sprint closer, Leg 2/4/6) represent a textbook team sprint construction: endurance athlete builds position, sprint specialist closes with explosive speed. The pairing uses complementary skills rather than duplicating the same profile. They competed together in the [Goms World Cup on January 23](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html), giving them team sprint race chemistry in the weeks before the Olympics.

**Risk Factors**
Kälin's limited sprint background (ranked 41st in sprint standings — [FIS Cup Standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html)) means Switzerland is dependent on Fähndrich not being buried in traffic. If the final develops into a pack sprint scenario, Fähndrich's ability to win from the lead group is excellent — but Kälin must first keep the team in contention during her laps.

## 5. USA — Jessie Diggins / Julia Kern (BIB 03)

**Verdict: Realistic bronze/outside medal chance. Diggins' final Olympic race; three Worlds medals together.**

**Current Form**
Diggins [won the Tour de Ski for the third time](https://snowbrains.com/u-s-cross-country-skier-jessie-diggins-wins-tour-de-ski-for-the-3rd-time/) in January 2026 — the most recent Tour de Ski overall champion is starting in this event. She then [won Olympic bronze in the 10km freestyle on February 8](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/diggins-wins-fourth-olympic-medal-bronze-10k-skate) despite carrying [bruised ribs from a crash during the skiathlon](https://www.powder.com/news/jessie-diggins-skier-milan-cortina-2026). Kern [finished 6th in the Olympic sprint classic final](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/berkeley-julia-kern-cross-country-sprint/4031977/) on February 10 — her best individual Olympic sprint result and a demonstration of form. The [USA relay finished 5th on February 14](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/23906), consistent with their standing in the field.

**Freestyle Technique Fit**
Diggins has [Olympic gold in team sprint free (2018)](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/jessie-diggins-meet-athlete) ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/winter-olympics-2018-us-women-win-first-cross-country-olympic-gold-medal/)) and multiple World Cup sprint wins in free technique — though her primary strength remains distance freestyle. Kern [earned World Championship bronze in team sprint free with Diggins in 2023](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/athletes/julia-kern), establishing their free technique credentials. The combination is well-suited to this discipline.

**Course Profile Fit**
Diggins is a [three-time Tour de Ski overall champion](https://snowbrains.com/u-s-cross-country-skier-jessie-diggins-wins-tour-de-ski-for-the-3rd-time/) with a mountain finish stage victory — her climbing ability and aerobic endurance in a repeated-effort format is exceptional. Kern's sprint speed rounds out the pairing. The multi-lap nature of the team sprint final favors Diggins' specific combination of aerobic capacity and sprint competency.

**Venue History**
Diggins [finished 3rd in the Olympic 10km Free at Tesero on February 8](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/diggins-wins-fourth-olympic-medal-bronze-10k-skate) — she has won an Olympic medal at this exact venue in this Olympic cycle. Kern [raced the sprint classic final at Tesero on February 10](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/berkeley-julia-kern-cross-country-sprint/4031977/). Additionally, Diggins [won the 2013 World Championship Women's Team Sprint at Val di Fiemme](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/teams-day-everything-you-need-to-know-biathlon-relay-short-track-relay-team-sprint-cross-country) — a gold medal on this course 13 years ago. She returns to where she first became a World Champion.

**Team Chemistry**
Diggins and Kern have [raced the team sprint together at four major championships](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/athletes/julia-kern) (2021 Worlds silver, 2023 Worlds bronze, 2025 Worlds silver). Their four-event partnership is the most tested pairing chemistry in the field outside of Sundling/Dahlqvist. Kern describes her role as the sprint closer; Diggins handles the distance legs with endurance advantage.

**Risk Factors**
Diggins is managing bruised ribs and has already raced a 10km individual event and a relay leg in this Games. Cumulative fatigue is a real factor. She is also [retiring after this season](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/one-final-season-jessie-diggins-announces-retirement-following-end-2025-26-season) — the emotional weight of a final Olympic race can cut either way. USA has the talent for a podium but requires ideal conditions and execution to displace Norway or Germany.
