## Key Storylines
Two-time Olympian and Kazakhstan's most experienced women's cross-country skier alongside Ryazhko. Stepashkina grew up in Shchuchinsk, Akmola region — a city with a strong cross-country skiing tradition in Kazakhstan, situated near the Burabay National Park winter sports complex. Her career best 8th at Toblach is among Kazakhstan's strongest individual World Cup results in women's cross-country skiing. Both her Olympic relay finishes (15th at Beijing 2022 and 15th at Milano Cortina 2026) show remarkable consistency at the top level. The Astana Times reported in early 2026 that Kazakhstan was enjoying success across winter sports events, with the cross-country team contributing to national momentum. As the more accomplished individual racer in the Kazakhstan team sprint duo, her relay experience translates directly to the team sprint format's demands.

**Pairing note:** Stepashkina is Kazakhstan's most dependable World Cup performer; paired with Ryazhko's relay experience, Kazakhstan brings a cohesive two-athlete team. Their consistent 15th-place relay finishes across two Olympic cycles suggest reliable execution under pressure.
