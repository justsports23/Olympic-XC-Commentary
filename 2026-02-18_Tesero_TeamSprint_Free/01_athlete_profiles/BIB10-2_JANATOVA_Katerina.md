## Key Storylines
Janatová is the Czech Republic's standout performer at these Olympics, having placed 7th in the skiathlon on February 7 — ahead of American star Jessie Diggins who crashed out on the first lap ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-imperial-frida-karlsson-triumphs-in-the-skiathlon-leonie-perry-16th-0207/)). The result shows her all-around capability and confidence on the Tesero course. She brings crucial course knowledge into the team sprint. Her 7th-place finish at the 2023 Planica World Championships in the women's team sprint free is directly relevant experience for this event ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=192498)). With Sandra Schuetzova as her partner, the Czech pair has a combination of veteran experience and in-form confidence. Competes with Fischer skis ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate%C5%99ina_Janatov%C3%A1)).

## Personal Background
Kateřina Janatová was born March 13, 1997 in the Czech Republic ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate%C5%99ina_Janatov%C3%A1)). She has spent significant training time in Norway — a common development step for ambitious Czech Nordic skiers — which has shaped her freestyle technique and tactical understanding of racing ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/training/katerina-janatova-on-roller-skis-training-in-norway-and-staying-safe/)). Her 7th-place finish in the Olympic skiathlon on February 7, 2026 — ahead of Jessie Diggins and close to the podium — announced her as one of the more dangerous threats in the Czech program ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-imperial-frida-karlsson-triumphs-in-the-skiathlon-leonie-perry-16th-0207/)). She is a versatile all-around skier who can compete in skiathlon, distance, sprint, and team sprint formats at the World Cup and championship level ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=192498)).
