## Career Summary
Tena Hadžić is a two-time Olympian representing Croatia, having competed at both Beijing 2022 and Milano Cortina 2026. She [made her Olympic debut at age 17 at Beijing 2022](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/cross-country-skiing/athlete-profile-n1036083-tena-hadzic.htm) and was Croatia's youngest athlete at those Games; she carried the [Croatian flag at the Beijing 2022 closing ceremony](https://total-croatia-news.com/news/sport/tena-hadzic/). She trains with SK Sljeme Zagreb — based on Sljeme mountain in the Medvednica Nature Park north of Zagreb, one of Croatia's premier winter sports venues. She has competed at three FIS Nordic World Ski Championships; her career highlight is a [16th place finish in the Women's Team Sprint Free at the 2023 World Championships](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=238379). The Croatian team sprint pair achieved 20th in Women's Team Sprint Classic at Beijing 2022. She did not advance beyond the sprint qualifier at 2026 Milano Cortina. At 21 years old and with a World Cup standing in the top 10 this season, Hadzic is one of the most promising athletes in this lower-seeded bracket. She [will carry the Croatian flag at the 2026 closing ceremony](https://total-croatia-news.com/news/sport/tena-hadzic/) — an extraordinary honor of being both an opening and closing ceremony flag bearer within a single Olympic cycle.

## Key Strengths
Primarily a sprint specialist with growing World Cup credentials. Her 2025/26 World Cup ranking in the top 8 overall and top 7 in sprint is outstanding for this bib range and suggests Croatia's team is significantly underseeded relative to individual form. Strong in freestyle (skate) technique and short-format events. One of the most World Cup-competitive athletes in the entire lower bracket.

## Key Storylines
Hadzic is arguably the most World Cup-competitive athlete in the entire lower half of this team sprint draw. With a top-8 overall World Cup standing this season and top-7 sprint ranking, she and Sobol should be competitive against higher-seeded teams. Her dual flag-bearing honor — closing ceremony in Beijing, closing ceremony in Milano Cortina — reflects her status as Croatia's most decorated winter sports figure at this Games. That she could not advance past the sprint qualifier is somewhat surprising given her World Cup form and adds motivation for the team sprint. Her Zagreb club on Sljeme Mountain provides unique Nordic training infrastructure in a non-traditional skiing country.

**Pairing note:** This is one of the most asymmetric pairings in the field — Hadzic is top-8 World Cup ranked, Sobol is 18 years old with limited international results. Hadzic essentially carries this team sprint on her back, but Sobol's inclusion signals Croatia's investment in succession planning. The question is whether Sobol can contribute competitively or simply execute her legs efficiently.
