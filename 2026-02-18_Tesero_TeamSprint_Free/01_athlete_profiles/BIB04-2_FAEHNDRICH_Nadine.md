## Key Storylines
Nadine Fähndrich is Switzerland's sprint ace — a 30-year-old veteran with elite-level credentials across all sprint disciplines ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162603&type=result)). In January 2026 she won the Tour de Ski Sprint Classic at the Olympic venue of Val di Fiemme, exactly where the team sprint will be contested on February 18 ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/faehndrich-wins-sprint-on-olympic-tracks-as-klaebo-extends-tour-lead)). This gives her exceptional course knowledge and confidence on this specific track. Just weeks earlier she was second in the same event at the same venue ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-val-di-fiemme-nadine-faehndrich-finds-her-way-back-to-victory-in-the-classic-sprint-of-the-tour-de-ski-0103/)). Her Tour de Ski sprint title at Val di Fiemme was her sixth career World Cup win [UNVERIFIED]. She finished second in the Tour de Ski sprint standings (47 points vs Dahlqvist's 53 points) ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/sprint-classic-val-di-fiemme-italy-2024-25-tour-de-ski)). Fähndrich has a history of podiums at World Championships and is a three-time Olympian ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/nadine-faehndrich)), with her best Olympic result being a 4th in the team sprint free at PyeongChang 2018 [UNVERIFIED]. The Swiss team of Kälin (distance engine) and Fähndrich (sprint closer) is a well-balanced pairing that should contend for medals, especially given Fähndrich's recent dominant performances at this exact venue.

## Personal Background
Nadine Fähndrich was born October 16, 1995 in the Lucerne canton of Switzerland and represents Skiclub Horw — a club in the Lucerne area ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162603&type=result)). She grew up in central Switzerland outside the traditional alpine ski meccas of the Engadine or Valais, but developed into Switzerland's premier sprint skier through dedication and technical excellence. A three-time Olympian (PyeongChang 2018, Beijing 2022, Milano Cortina 2026) ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/nadine-faehndrich)), she is one of Switzerland's most experienced cross-country skiers. Her Val di Fiemme victory in the Tour de Ski sprint classic in January 2026 was her sixth career World Cup win [UNVERIFIED], and came at the precise Olympic venue she will race on February 18 ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/faehndrich-wins-sprint-on-olympic-tracks-as-klaebo-extends-tour-lead)) — making it one of the most directly relevant pre-Olympic performances in the field.
