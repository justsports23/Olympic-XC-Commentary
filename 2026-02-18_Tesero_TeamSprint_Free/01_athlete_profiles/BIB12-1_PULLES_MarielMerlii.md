## Key Storylines
Two-time Olympian competing in her third major championship relay at Tesero ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/mariel-merlii-pulles)). Pulles and Keidy Kaasiku form the Estonia team sprint pair, with both athletes having extensive relay and sprint experience together. The duo finished 13th in the Olympic relay on February 15 ([Olympics.com Milano Cortina](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/22014)). Pulles is based at the University of Alaska Fairbanks — a common training ground for Scandinavian and Baltic skiers seeking quality facilities. Her FISU World University Games double in Lake Placid 2023 (mass start and sprint gold) demonstrates her versatility ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/mariel-merlii-pulles-cross-country-skiing-spf176206.html)). She competes across individual sprint and team sprint formats on the World Cup circuit ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=193905)).

## Personal Background
Mariel Merlii Pulles was born November 1, 1998 ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=193905)). She was educated at Otepää High School in Otepää — the Estonian "Winter Capital," a small town in southern Estonia renowned as the center of Estonian cross-country skiing and home to the annual Tartu Marathon ([ERR](https://news.err.ee/1609585319/estonian-twins-take-top-two-cross-country-ski-race-spots-at-turin-student-games)). She subsequently trained at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), a well-known pathway for Scandinavian and Baltic skiers seeking North American World Cup experience and coaching access. Her double given name "Mariel Merlii" is characteristic of Estonian naming traditions and creates a distinctive compound first name. She has competed in SuperTour events in Anchorage, Alaska, winning a skate sprint there in January 2025 ([Nordic Insights](https://nordicinsights.news/2025/01/07/michael-earnhart-mariel-merlii-pulles-win-supertour-skate-sprint-in-anchorage/)).
