## Key Storylines
Jasmi Joensuu is one of the most compelling stories in Nordic skiing — she took an unconventional path by attending the University of Denver (where she was a 3× All-American and part of two NCAA championship teams) before competing professionally. She was the Sprint World Cup overall champion in the 2024-25 season. In the 2025-26 season, she won two consecutive Tour de Ski sprint classic stages at Toblach and at Val di Fiemme — the exact Olympic venue where the team sprint will be held. This gives her perhaps the most relevant recent course-specific form of any competitor. She claimed her first individual World Cup win at Val di Fiemme on January 3, 2026, calling it a "perfect" win on the Olympic tracks. Just days before the team sprint, she anchored Finland to relay bronze on February 14. Her relay partners called her final leg crucial, as she held off the chase pack. The team sprint pairing with Jasmin Kähärä is Finland's top option; Joensuu's classic sprint dominance gives them strong potential in the free technique discipline as well. FIS described her Val di Fiemme win as "claiming the perfect first World Cup win on Olympic course."

## Personal Background
Jasmi Joensuu was born May 7, 1996 in Vantaa, a city immediately north of Helsinki, and represents Vantaa Ski Club. She took an unusual path to elite skiing by attending the University of Denver in Colorado, USA, competing as an NCAA alpine skier and earning three All-American selections while being part of two NCAA championship teams (2016, 2018). She then transitioned to the Finnish national team, combining her US college experience with professional World Cup competition — a rare dual trajectory in Nordic skiing. The "Joensuu" name in Finnish literally means "mouth of a river," as Joensuu is also a Finnish city. She is fluent in Finnish, English, and reportedly Swedish. Her Skirious Problems podcast episode documented her journey from college skiing to becoming Sprint World Cup champion.
