## Key Storylines
Skinder and Izabela Marcisz are the returning Poland team sprint pair, having finished 9th together at the 2022 Beijing Olympics ([Beijing 2022 profile](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games//en/results/cross-country-skiing/athlete-profile-n1032076-monika-skinder.htm)). That experience gives them an edge in team chemistry and tactical awareness. Skinder's strengths are particularly concentrated in sprint events — her junior career was dominated by sprint medals at world level (gold at 2021 Junior Worlds, silver at 2022 U23 Worlds) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monika_Skinder)). She made her World Championships debut at just 17 years old in 2019 at Seefeld, where the Poland team sprint pairing achieved 10th place ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=208984)). Her World Cup debut came in Lahti in 2017 ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=208984)). Born in Tomaszów Lubelski, she brings four World Championships appearances worth of experience to the Olympic team sprint.

## Personal Background
Monika Skinder was born November 19, 2001 in Tomaszów Lubelski — a town in the Lublin Voivodeship of eastern Poland near the Ukrainian border ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monika_Skinder)). The Lublin region is not traditionally associated with skiing, making her development into an elite sprint skier all the more notable. She made her World Championships debut at just 17 years old in Seefeld 2019 ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=208984)). Her junior career was defined by two major medals: gold at the 2021 Junior World Championships in sprint classic (Vuokatti, Finland) and silver at the 2022 U23 World Championships in sprint free (Lygna, Norway) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monika_Skinder)). She won gold in the girls' sprint at the 2019 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival in Sarajevo at age 17 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monika_Skinder)). The surname "Skinder" is spelled phonetically in English and follows standard Polish pronunciation with stress on the first syllable.
