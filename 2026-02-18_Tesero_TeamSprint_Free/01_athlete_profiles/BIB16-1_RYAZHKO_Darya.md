## Key Storylines
First Olympic Games ([Kazakhstan at 2026 Winter Olympics — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics)). Ryazhko is part of Kazakhstan's improving women's cross-country ski program which has made significant strides in relay performance. The team's 15th-place relay finish at the 2026 Olympics and 11th-place relay finish at the 2021 World Championships show Kazakhstan's growing competitiveness ([Flashscore](https://www.flashscoreusa.com/player/ryazhko-darya/Szzlgg2e/)). Kazakhstan's World Cup team is based primarily in Shchuchinsk and the Burabay National Park region — a winter sports hub in the Akmola region of northern Kazakhstan ([The Astana Times](https://astanatimes.com/2026/02/week-one-at-milano-cortina-kazakhstans-olympic-opening/)). Her World Cup career best of 14th at Beitostolen demonstrates individual competitive potential in the right conditions ([Flashscore](https://www.flashscoreusa.com/player/ryazhko-darya/Szzlgg2e/)). Partnering with Nadezhda Stepashkina — a more experienced two-time Olympian — provides the Kazakhstan team sprint with an experienced anchor.

**Pairing note:** Ryazhko is the less sprint-experienced of the two; Stepashkina's two Olympic cycles and career best 8th at Toblach provides the superior individual pedigree. Kazakhstan's team sprint is built around Stepashkina's reliability with Ryazhko contributing relay-tested endurance.
