## Key Storylines
Iris De Martin Pinter is Italy's most exciting young sprint talent — born in 2004, she is just 21 years old and competing at her first Olympic Games on home soil ([CONI](https://milanocortina2026.coni.it/en/italia-team/team/scheda_atleta/2676:Iris_DE_MARTIN_PINTER.html)). Her 6th-place finish in the Sprint Free World Cup in Oberhof in January 2026 was a historic moment for Italian cross-country skiing, ending a more than five-year absence from sprint finals ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-italy-unveils-its-sprint-skate-team-with-a-royal-mens-duo-0216/)). The Italian sprint program had been largely absent from finals for years; De Martin Pinter's result signaled a new generation is arriving. From the Veneto region of Italy, she competes at Tesero/Val di Fiemme as a near-local, which brings natural home crowd support ([CONI](https://milanocortina2026.coni.it/en/italia-team/team/scheda_atleta/2676:Iris_DE_MARTIN_PINTER.html)). She won a World Youth Olympic gold in the 5km classic in 2022 ([Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81902548)). Her speed and explosiveness make her the ideal sprint closer for Italy's team sprint partnership with Caterina Ganz ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-italy-unveils-its-sprint-skate-team-with-a-royal-mens-duo-0216/)). The Fondoitalia website and Italian sporting media have highlighted this team sprint as Italy's great opportunity for a surprise medal, noting their "royal duo" chemistry [UNVERIFIED]. At just 21, this is the beginning of what could be an extended Olympic career for De Martin Pinter.

## Personal Background
Iris De Martin Pinter was born August 2, 2004 in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy, which borders Trentino-Alto Adige — the region where Tesero is located ([CONI](https://milanocortina2026.coni.it/en/italia-team/team/scheda_atleta/2676:Iris_DE_MARTIN_PINTER.html)). She competes on near-home snow and has the support of the local Italian crowd. Her double surname "De Martin Pinter" reflects the compound family name tradition common in Veneto and the Ladin-speaking communities of the Dolomites. The "De Martin" component is a patrician Venetian prefix. At just 21 years old, she is Italy's youngest competitor in this event and one of the youngest in the overall women's team sprint field ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/26632)). She was supported by the Fondazione Cortina, the foundation associated with the host organization for the 2021 World Championships, indicating early recognition of her talent [UNVERIFIED].
