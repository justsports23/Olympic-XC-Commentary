## Key Storylines
Astrid Øyre Slind is one of the most remarkable stories at the 2026 Olympics ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/she-almost-retired-at-26-now-at-her-first-olympics-astrid-oyre-slind-has-a-gold-medal-at-age-38/)). She is a twin sister of Silje Øyre Slind and older sister of Kari Øyre Slind, all of whom are skiers. Having nearly retired at age 26, she persisted to become one of Norway's premier distance skiers ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/she-almost-retired-at-26-now-at-her-first-olympics-astrid-oyre-slind-has-a-gold-medal-at-age-38/)). At age 38, she made her Olympic debut at Milano Cortina 2026 — and won gold in the relay on February 14 ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42289)). She was the oldest competitor in the freestyle race and one of only two athletes born in the 1980s among the 111 starters [UNVERIFIED]. In the 2025-26 season, she broke through with multiple World Cup wins after going winless for years ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/slind-beats-niskanen-and-johaug-to-claim-first-world-cup-win-in-davos-20km)). She held second place in Tour de Ski standings after Stage 2 before withdrawing ([All Things Nordic](https://all-things-nordic.com/2025/12/30/fis-cross-country-skiing-world-cup-2025-26-toblach-tour-de-ski-stage-2-astrid-slind-norway-wins-womens-interval-start-classic/)). Her team sprint pairing with Julie Bjervig Drivenes finished second in Goms just weeks before the Olympics ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/gimmler-and-rydzek-boost-germany-s-olympic-hopes-with-goms-team-sprint-win)), demonstrating their readiness. In the team sprint free, Slind's distance endurance is the foundation while Drivenes provides explosive sprint speed.

## Personal Background
Astrid Øyre Slind was born and raised in Oppdal, a small mountain municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway — one of Norway's premier cross-country skiing communities ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/she-almost-retired-at-26-now-at-her-first-olympics-astrid-oyre-slind-has-a-gold-medal-at-age-38/)). She is the twin sister of Silje Øyre Slind and older sister of Kari Øyre Slind, both professional cross-country skiers; the trio represent a remarkable family of elite Nordic athletes. Having grown up skiing in Oppdal's trails, Astrid nearly retired at age 26 due to injuries and lack of results before rededicating herself to the sport ([FasterSkier](https://fasterskier.com/2026/02/she-almost-retired-at-26-now-at-her-first-olympics-astrid-oyre-slind-has-a-gold-medal-at-age-38/)). She represents Oppdal IL as her home club. Her journey from near-retirement to Olympic gold at 38 has been widely covered in Norwegian and international media as one of the sport's great comeback stories ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2026/02/14/olympics-milan-cortina-sweden-norway-cross-country/57426788-09a2-11f1-b196-5e1986b3575c_story.html)).
