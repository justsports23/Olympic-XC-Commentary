## Key Storylines
Bucher is one of the youngest athletes in the Olympic team sprint field at just 19 years old, making her first Olympic appearance. Born and raised in Hall in Tirol in the Austrian Alps, she moved up to the World Cup after demonstrating strong form in the Continental Cup, where she was described by ProXCskiing as "a strong new sprinter for Austria." Her promotion to the World Cup this season has been successful, with the 7th-place team sprint result in Davos establishing her as a genuine World Cup sprint competitor. The Austrian relay finishing 10th on February 15 gives Bucher and Magdalena Scherz course familiarity at Tesero heading into the team sprint. She won a sprint gold at the European Youth Olympic Festival in 2023 in classic technique, underlining that her sprint credentials span both techniques.

**Pairing note:** Bucher brings youth and raw sprint speed; Scherz brings World Cup experience and team sprint know-how from Worlds. Together they form a complementary Austrian pair with experience in this specific format at multiple major championship levels.
