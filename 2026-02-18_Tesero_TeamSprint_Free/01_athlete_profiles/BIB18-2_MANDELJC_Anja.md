## Career Summary
Anja Mandeljc is a two-time Olympian, competing at Beijing 2022 (59th in Sprint, 66th in 10km Individual) and again at Milano Cortina 2026 (48th in 10km Individual) ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/anja-mandeljc)). She is Slovenia's most experienced active distance skier and has competed at three FIS Nordic World Ski Championships ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=194004)). Her career highlight is an [8th place finish in the Women's Team Sprint Free at the 2023 Planica World Championships](https://www.the-sports.org/anja-mandeljc-cross-country-skiing-spf375423.html), making her Slovenia's best-ever team sprint result at a World Championships. At the 2025 Trondheim World Championships she placed 21st in the 10km Individual and 24th in the Skiathlon ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/anja-mandeljc-cross-country-skiing-spf375423.html)). She has also competed in World Cup relay teams and is a consistent presence on the World Cup circuit ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=194004)). U-23 World Championships best: 24th (10km Individual, 2022) ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/anja-mandeljc-cross-country-skiing-spf375423.html)). Mandeljc trains with TSK Triglav Kranj, based near Kranj in the Gorenjska region of northwestern Slovenia, close to the Triglav National Park ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/slovenias-national-team-for-the-2022-2023-season/)).

## Key Strengths
Primarily a distance specialist with proven abilities in mass start and interval formats. Her 8th place World Champs team sprint result in 2023 shows genuine capacity in the team sprint format ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/anja-mandeljc-cross-country-skiing-spf375423.html)). Strongest in freestyle (skate) technique; her World Cup best of 15th at Engadin reflects her distance/mass start profile ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=194004)). At 26 she is in the prime of her athletic career.

## Key Storylines
Mandeljc's 8th-place team sprint at the 2023 Planica World Championships — on home soil in Slovenia — is the headline result of her career and marks Slovenia's best-ever World Championship team sprint performance ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/anja-mandeljc-cross-country-skiing-spf375423.html)). As a two-time Olympian now leading Slovenia's team sprint as the senior partner ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/anja-mandeljc)), she brings exactly the kind of format-specific championship experience that matters in this event. Her 21st in the 10km at the 2025 Worlds confirms she remains competitive at the individual distance level ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/anja-mandeljc-cross-country-skiing-spf375423.html)). At these Games she teamed with the much younger Medja (21), taking on a mentor role while still being a genuine performer herself. TSK Triglav Kranj trains extensively on the Pokljuka plateau, giving Mandeljc strong high-altitude fitness base ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/slovenias-national-team-for-the-2022-2023-season/)).

**Pairing note:** Mandeljc is clearly the lead performer of this pair — her 8th at Worlds remains Slovenia's best team sprint result ever ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/anja-mandeljc-cross-country-skiing-spf375423.html)). Medja as junior partner plays support; Mandeljc's experience and World Cup distance results ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=194004)) give Slovenia a genuine competitive edge over several teams in the lower bracket.
