## Key Storylines
Olympic debut at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games. Cridland is part of the new generation of Australian cross-country skiing — alongside her partner Rosie Fordham — lifting Australian results to new heights. She is based in the Northern Hemisphere for competition, part of Australia's expanding World Cup presence. Their 12th-place finish at the 2025 World Championships relay in Trondheim, and 14th at the 2026 Olympics relay, are Australia's strongest relay results in recent history. Cridland's career best 17th in Falun shows she can compete individually at the top of the World Cup field on the right day. Selected for the Australian 2025/26 national team as a returning World Championship competitor.

## Personal Background
Phoebe Cridland was born August 8, 2001. She grew up in Sydney and attended PLC Sydney before moving to SCEGGS (Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School). She also had a background in gymnastics, which she credits with sharpening her balance and coordination on snow. She was selected for the Australian national team at just 15 years old — an unusually early selection indicating her rapid development. She studied Science and Law at Sydney University while competing internationally, being part of the Sydney University Elite Athlete Program. Australia's cross-country ski team is based primarily in Scandinavia during competition season, with athletes training in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Her partnership with Rosie Fordham has established the strongest Australian women's XC ski team sprint duo in the country's history.
