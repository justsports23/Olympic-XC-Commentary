## Career Summary
Ema Sobol is making her first Olympic appearance at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games at just 18 years old, making her one of the youngest competitors in the team sprint field ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=275954&type=result)). A native of [Rijeka](https://www.croatiaweek.com/croatia-14-athletes-milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics/) -- Croatia's major Adriatic port city and third-largest city -- she was born December 5, 2007. Rijeka's coastal Mediterranean climate is an unusual background for a cross-country skier; she would need to travel to mountain venues to train on snow. She has competed at one FIS Nordic World Ski Championships; at the 2025 Trondheim World Championships she finished [67th in the Sprint Free](https://www.portal.hr/en/novosti/sport-hr/104914-zoi-u-utorak-prvi-hrvatski-nastupi-u-brzom-klizanju-skijaskom-trcanju-i-biatlonu) event. At the 2026 Olympics, she competed in the Sprint Classic qualifier (starting number 73) and finished 75th, not advancing to the finals ([Portal.hr](https://www.portal.hr/en/novosti/sport-hr/104925-zoi-hadzic-i-sobol-nisu-prosle-kvalifikacije)). She did not qualify for the sprint final alongside HADZIC ([Portal.hr](https://www.portal.hr/en/novosti/sport-hr/104925-zoi-hadzic-i-sobol-nisu-prosle-kvalifikacije)). Her World Champs relay result of 17th in the Women's 4 x 7.5km Relay at the 2025 World Championships (with the Croatian team) represents a strong national team performance ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=275954&type=result)).

## Key Strengths
A very young cross-country skier at the beginning of her international career, partnering with the far more experienced and World Cup-ranked HADZIC Tena for the team sprint ([Croatia Week](https://www.croatiaweek.com/croatia-14-athletes-milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics/)). Her inclusion on the Olympic team at 18 signals Croatia's confidence in her development trajectory. Growing up in Rijeka ([Croatia Week](https://www.croatiaweek.com/croatia-14-athletes-milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics/)) means her skiing development likely centered on organized club travel to mountain venues.

## Key Storylines
At 18, Sobol is one of the youngest Olympians in the women's cross-country field at these Games ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=275954&type=result)). Coming from Rijeka -- a coastal city with no natural snow ([Croatia Week](https://www.croatiaweek.com/croatia-14-athletes-milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics/)) -- her path to the Olympics required specific dedication and likely significant family support to access training environments. The [Portal.hr](https://www.portal.hr/en/novosti/sport-hr/104925-zoi-hadzic-i-sobol-nisu-prosle-kvalifikacije) Croatian sports outlet reported her and Hadzic's sprint qualifier elimination, noting it as an early test before the team sprint. Pairing with Croatia's top individual cross-country performer in Hadzic provides her with an exceptional development environment at these Games.

**Pairing note:** Sobol's role is clearly to execute her legs adequately and give Hadzic the baton in competitive position. For Sobol, this Olympic experience alongside a top-8 World Cup performer is itself the primary development value. Croatia's team sprint performance will largely depend on Hadzic's legs.
