## Career Summary
Bruna Moura is one of cross-country skiing's most remarkable human interest stories. Born on April 24, 1994, in Caraguatatuba, São Paulo state — a coastal city on the Atlantic shore of Brazil — she came to skiing through mountain biking, bringing an endurance athlete's foundation to the snow sports world. She competed at her first international race in 2015 and made her World Championships debut at [Lahti 2017](https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/17/sport/bruna-moura-brazil-olympian). On 16 January 2022 she secured Brazil's Olympic quota place, only to contract COVID-19 days later; then on January 27, she survived a [devastating head-on car crash in Italy](https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/bruna-moura-cross-country-skiing-brazil) in which the other person in her vehicle did not survive, ending any chance of competing at Beijing 2022. She later underwent [cardiac surgery for a pre-existing heart condition](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-accident-heart-surgery-illness-and-mourning-brazils-bruna-moura-sees-her-olympic-dream-through-to-the-end-0212/), and in 2024 contracted toxoplasmosis, losing 25% of her vision. She returned to World Championships competition at Planica 2023. She has competed at four FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in total; her best team result is [18th in the Women's 4 x 7.5km Relay at the 2025 World Championships](https://firstskisport.com/cross-country/athlete.php?id=3180&g=w). At the 2026 Olympics she finally reached the Olympic start line, finishing 74th in the Sprint Classic and 99th in the 10km Individual, [receiving a standing ovation at the finish](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-accident-heart-surgery-illness-and-mourning-brazils-bruna-moura-sees-her-olympic-dream-through-to-the-end-0212/). CNN ran a feature on her story titled "Covid, carnage and convalescence." NBC Sports covered her story extensively. The Olympics.com feature detailed her entire journey as one of the Games' most inspiring narratives.

## Key Strengths
A veteran distance skier with exceptional mental resilience. A former mountain biker, she brings endurance and adaptability to both classic and freestyle formats. Her experience across four World Championships provides leadership for the Brazilian team. Despite losing 25% of her vision to toxoplasmosis, she continues to compete at Olympic level. At 31 she is the clear veteran leader of Brazil's team sprint pair.

## Key Storylines
Moura's journey to the 2026 Olympics stands as one of the most emotionally powerful stories at these Games. Starting from Caraguatatuba on the Brazilian Atlantic coast, she overcame: a life-threatening car crash in Italy (January 2022) in which the other occupant died; COVID-19; cardiac surgery; and vision loss from toxoplasmosis — all in the span of four years. The standing ovation she received at the 2026 Olympic finish line captured perfectly the weight of everything she had survived to stand on an Olympic course. CNN's February 2026 feature, NBC Sports' coverage, and the Olympics.com exclusive all became widely shared stories of human determination. Her partnership with young Eduarda Ribera — who carries Brazil's competitive sprint hopes — makes this pairing a perfect generational complement.

**Pairing note:** Moura is the veteran heart of this Brazilian pair, carrying emotional weight and team experience; Ribera is the competitive engine with the World Cup 14th and Brazil's best individual results. Together they represent Brazil's past (Moura's journey) and future (Ribera's World Cup form) in cross-country skiing. This is the most compelling broadcast pairing in the field.
