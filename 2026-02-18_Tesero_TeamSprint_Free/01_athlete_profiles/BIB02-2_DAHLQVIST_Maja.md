## Key Storylines
Maja Dahlqvist has been one of the defining figures of women's cross-country sprint skiing over the past five years, winning the Sprint World Cup overall title twice (2022 and 2023) ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/maja-dahlqvist-wins-overall-sprint-world-cup/)). After a period without individual victories, she broke through in 2025 at Cogne in the Tour de Ski sprint classic ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/dahlqvist-sprints-to-first-world-cup-victory-since-2021-it-was-win-or-die-)), then capped her Olympics season with a bronze in the individual sprint classic at Milano Cortina 2026 ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/)). Sweden's sweep of gold (Linn Svahn), silver (Jonna Sundling), and bronze (Dahlqvist) in the women's sprint classic was only the fourth time Sweden won an Olympic triple in any event ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/)). Dahlqvist's long-term relationship with American skier Kevin Bolger has attracted interest, as the two began their relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic [UNVERIFIED]. Together with Sundling, she has been Sweden's primary team sprint engine — the duo won three consecutive World Championship team sprint titles ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/solid-team-sprint-win-in-davos-for-sweden-s-world-champions)). Their combined 106 World Cup podiums represent extraordinary depth for this event ([FIS Athlete Biography — Sundling](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=168267&type=result); [FIS Athlete Biography — Dahlqvist](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=168080&type=result)). Dahlqvist is in excellent form heading into the team sprint, having competed in the individual sprint final just days earlier ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/30716)).

## Personal Background
Maja Dahlqvist was born April 15, 1994 in Falun, the historic mining city in Dalarna county, Sweden — the spiritual home of Swedish cross-country skiing ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/maja-dahlqvist)). She represents Falun-Borlänge SK, the club that has produced many of Sweden's finest skiers. She is in a long-term relationship with American cross-country skier Kevin Bolger, a relationship that began during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and has attracted considerable media attention in both Sweden and the United States [UNVERIFIED]. The couple have been open about the logistical challenges of two international skiers based on different continents.
