## Career Summary
Lara Vanda Laczko is making her first Olympic appearance at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games at just 19 years old, making her one of the youngest competitors in the team sprint field ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=273644)). Born in Békéscsaba on 28 May 2006 — a city in southeastern Hungary — she is also a biathlete, having an [IBU athlete profile](https://www.biathlonworld.com/athlete/laczko-lara-vanda/BTHUN22805200601) alongside her FIS cross-country registration. At the 2025 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Trondheim, she competed in the cross-country events and she and PONYA Sara achieved a [24th place in the Women's Team Sprint Classic](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/lara-vanda-laczko). She has also competed in the Junior World Championships ([Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/156635)). At the 2026 Olympics, she finished 93rd in the Women's 10km Interval Start Freestyle ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=273644)), and her Junior Worlds best is 25th [UNVERIFIED]. She and PONYA were photographed together at the 2026 Games, representing Hungary's young team sprint pairing.

## Key Strengths
A young distance skier at the start of her career. Her willingness to take on longer events (10km, distance events at Worlds) suggests she is developing primarily as a distance racer. The dual cross-country/biathlon training background adds fitness versatility. The team sprint at these Games represents an early major championship experience alongside the more experienced PONYA Sara.

## Key Storylines
Laczko's first Olympics at 19 — born in Békéscsaba, a city with a modest winter sports tradition for Hungary — places her among the very youngest Olympians in the cross-country field ([Daily News Hungary](https://dailynewshungary.com/2026-winter-olympics-hungarys-15-athletes/)). Her involvement in biathlon alongside cross-country ([IBU profile](https://www.biathlonworld.com/athlete/laczko-lara-vanda/BTHUN22805200601) confirmed) is a common pathway for Hungarian winter athletes and adds to her endurance base. The 24th-place team sprint result at the 2025 Worlds is the defining result of her young career to date ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/lara-vanda-laczko)). She and Ponya's partnership, forged at that World Championships, comes to these Olympics as a tested combination.

**Pairing note:** Laczko as the younger partner brings energy and ambition; Ponya's dual-sport experience provides the tactical foundation. Hungary's 24th at the 2025 Worlds is modest but marks a stepping stone for a pairing that may develop further over the next Olympic cycle.
