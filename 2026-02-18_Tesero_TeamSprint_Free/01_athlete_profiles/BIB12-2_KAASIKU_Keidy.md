## Key Storylines
Keidy Kaasiku has a twin sister, Kaidy, who is also an Olympian (competed at Beijing 2022) — making them one of the rare twin pairs in Olympic cross-country skiing. Both sisters are physical education students at the University of Tartu. Keidy is the more decorated of the two at this point, with her FISU gold and stronger World Cup standing. She self-identifies as a distance skier rather than a sprinter, giving the Estonia team sprint pairing a different dynamic than a pure sprint specialist. Her ability to work effectively in relay format — demonstrated by the 13th-place Olympic relay finish on February 15 — transitions well to team sprint demands. Her 2 x 10th-place World Cup finishes represent Estonia's benchmark in individual competition.

## Personal Background
Keidy Kaasiku was born October 3, 2001. She is a physical education student at the University of Tartu — Estonia's oldest and most prestigious university, established in 1632. Her twin sister Kaidy Kaasiku is also an Olympic-level skier (competed at Beijing 2022), making the Kaasiku twins one of the rare twin pairs in Olympic cross-country skiing. Keidy is the elder of the two (by a matter of minutes in twin birth order [UNVERIFIED exact birth order]). The family lives in or near Otepää, Estonia's ski capital. Both sisters have been featured on a joint Instagram account [@kaasiku.twins](https://www.instagram.com/kaasiku.twins/). The name "Kaasiku" means "birch grove" in Estonian, fitting for a forest-connected Nordic skiing tradition. The FISU Games article described Keidy's FISU gold as an example of an Olympian pursuing university sporting excellence alongside elite international competition.
