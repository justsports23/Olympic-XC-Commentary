## Key Storylines
Laura Gimmler is Germany's linchpin in sprint and team events. Born and raised in Oberstdorf — Germany's Nordic skiing heartland — she represents SC Oberstdorf and uses Salomon equipment. Her partnership with Coletta Rydzek is Germany's most successful team sprint pairing. Together they won the World Cup Team Sprint Free in Goms on January 23, 2026, just weeks before the Olympics — their best-ever team result and a statement of intent heading to Milano Cortina. Germany has not won Olympic gold in the women's team sprint but Gimmler and Rydzek's Goms victory demonstrated they have the speed to win. The pair has built up significant team sprint chemistry over multiple seasons. Gimmler won a World Championship relay silver in 2023 with Germany and reached 4th in the Olympic relay in 2026. Her personal life has attracted attention in Germany and France due to her relationship with French alpine star Cyprien Sarrazin. She is 32 years old and in her second Olympics. Gimmler provides strong, consistent freestyle sprint legs for the German team.

## Personal Background
Laura Gimmler was born December 5, 1993 in Oberstdorf, Bavaria — one of Germany's most famous mountain resort towns and home to the Nordic Combined World Cup venue, Germany's largest ski jump, and a long tradition of Nordic skiing. Growing up in Oberstdorf, she trained through the local SC Oberstdorf club, which has produced multiple German ski champions. She is in a relationship with French alpine ski racer Cyprien Sarrazin — a high-profile partnership that has attracted media attention in both Germany and France. Sarrazin won the 2024 World Cup downhill title before suffering a serious crash at Bormio in January 2025. Gimmler's story of competing at her second Olympics while her partner recovers has been highlighted in European sports media.
