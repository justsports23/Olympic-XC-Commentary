## Key Storylines
First Olympic Games at just 20 years of age ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/alison-mackie/)). Mackie's 8th-place finish in the 10km freestyle at the 2026 Olympics is Canada's best-ever Olympic result in a women's 10km in free technique and the best Canadian individual Olympic performance in 20 years (since Chandra Crawford's 2006 sprint gold) ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/2026/02/12/canadian-olympic-best-ever-result-for-20-year-old-cross-country-skier-alison-mackie/)) ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-eighth-in-the-individual-skate-alison-mackie-signs-the-best-result-for-a-canadian-in-20-years-0212/)). She is the leading U23 skier on the World Cup in her debut year. Her two Junior World Championship bronze medals in 2025 made her the first Canadian woman since 1989 to win a world junior medal ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Mackie)). Competing alongside Liliane Gagnon in the team sprint, the Canadian duo represents an exciting young pairing with legitimate podium potential. Based in Canmore, Alberta ([Nordiq Canada](https://nordiqcanada.ca/athlete/alison-mackie/)).
