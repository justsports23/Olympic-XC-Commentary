## Key Storylines
Fordham is arguably the most significant breakout story in Australian cross-country skiing history. Her 13th-place finish in the 10km freestyle at the Davos World Cup in December 2025 was the best individual World Cup result in the history of Australian cross-country skiing. Her U23 silver medal in February 2025 was Australia's first-ever international cross-country skiing podium. At the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim, her 20th place in the 50km mass start was Australia's best individual distance finish at a senior Worlds. Based in Fairbanks, Alaska, training at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Born in Sydney. Her pairing with Phoebe Cridland in the team sprint represents Australia's strongest Olympic team sprint appearance.

## Personal Background
Rosie Fordham was born July 5, 2002 in Sydney, NSW, and now resides in Fairbanks, Alaska, where she trains at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) — one of the premier cross-country ski training institutions in North America and a common choice for athletes from smaller skiing nations seeking world-class facilities and coaching. Growing up in Sydney, she did not have the traditional European or North American skiing upbringing, but developed rapidly once exposed to structured training. Nordic Mag asked in a feature article: "Who is Rosie Fordham, the first Australian to win a medal at a world event?" — reflecting her status as a genuine historic figure in Australian skiing.
