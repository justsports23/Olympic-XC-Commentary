## Key Storylines
Scherz is Austria's experienced sprint partner for Heidi Bucher in the Olympic team sprint. Based in Vienna, she trains with the Austrian national team ([Ski Austria](https://www.skiaustria.at/de/teams/magdalena-scherz)) and has established herself as one of Austria's top sprint specialists. Together at Davos in December 2025 they reached 7th place in the World Cup team sprint ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=226149)), and at the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim, the Austrian team sprint pair reached 13th place in the classic team sprint — a result that gave them confidence heading into Olympic competition ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=226149)). At the 2026 Olympics she entered the sprint classic qualification (35th), gaining experience on the Tesero circuit ahead of the team sprint ([Olympics.com Milano Cortina](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/19365)). Her progression from quarterfinalist status at Davos to a 13th-place World Champs result shows steady development in team sprint format. An ORF Sport report noted she and partner Mrkonjic were eliminated in sprint quarterfinals at Davos in the 2024-25 season, showing year-on-year improvement to the 7th-place result in the same venue with Bucher in 2025-26 ([ORF Sport](https://sport.orf.at/stories/3148975/)).

**Pairing note:** Scherz as the senior, more experienced partner leads this pair's tactical decisions, while Bucher's raw sprint speed provides the attacking capacity. Their 13th at Worlds and 7th at World Cup demonstrates this is a functional, improving combination.
