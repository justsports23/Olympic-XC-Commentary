## Key Storylines
With six World Championship appearances, Auziņa is the most experienced member of the Latvian team sprint pair and one of the most veteran Latvian cross-country skiers at these Games. She is a backbone of the Latvian relay program, having anchored or contributed to their consistent 13th–17th place relay finishes at the most recent World Championships and two Olympic Games. Latvia's relay finished 17th at the 2026 Olympics, consistent with their 17th-place finish at Beijing 2022, providing proof of the team's reliable international standard. The LSM national broadcaster reported the relay finish positively as confirmation of Latvian cross-country's standing. She and Patricija Eiduka form an experienced Latvia pairing with complementary strengths — Auziņa's relay experience and consistency alongside Eiduka's ascending individual World Cup results.

**Pairing note:** Auziņa is the steady relay anchor paired with Eiduka's explosive individual form. Together they bring Latvia's best combination of experience depth and upside — Eiduka does the heavy lifting athletically, Auziņa provides stability and team-racing savvy.
