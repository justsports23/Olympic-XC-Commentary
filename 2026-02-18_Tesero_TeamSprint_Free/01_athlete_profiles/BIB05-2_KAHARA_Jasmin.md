## Key Storylines
Jasmin Kähärä is Finland's young sprint talent, pairing with the more experienced Jasmi Joensuu in the team sprint ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-womens-team-sprint/)). Born in 2000, she is among the youngest athletes in the field. Her U23 World Championship gold in the Sprint Classic in 2023 at Whistler marked her as a future elite sprinter ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/jasmin-kahara-wins-the-sprint-race-at-the-u23-world-championships/)). At the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim, she reached 14th in the sprint free — a solid senior championship result ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=213187)). In the 2025-26 World Cup season, she is ranked 17th in the sprint standings, showing steady progression ([FIS Cup Standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html?sectorcode=CC&seasoncode=2026&cupcode=WC&disciplinecode=ALL&gendercode=W&nationcode=)). At the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics, she qualified for the sprint classic and placed 23rd ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/jasmin-kahara)). She competed in the Goms Team Sprint qualifier alongside Joensuu, giving them race experience together before the Olympic team sprint [UNVERIFIED]. The Finland team sprint pairing of Kähärä and Joensuu has chemistry from their Goms appearance, and both are in strong sprint form at the Olympic venue. Kähärä uses Fischer skis [UNVERIFIED], which are well-regarded for sprint performance. Her role is to provide speed on the final exchanges and contribute to relay-paced legs in the team sprint format.

## Personal Background
Jasmin Kähärä was born May 4, 2000 ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=213187)). Her U23 World Championship gold in sprint classic at Whistler in 2023 identified her as Finland's next sprint talent after Joensuu ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/jasmin-kahara-wins-the-sprint-race-at-the-u23-world-championships/)). The surname "Kähärä" is a Finnish name with the double umlaut (ä) characteristic of Finnish; both vowels are pronounced like the "a" in "cat." She competes on the World Cup sprint circuit and is developing into a reliable sprint finisher for Finland's national team.
