## Key Storylines
Julie Bjervig Drivenes is one of Norway's emerging sprint talents, representing a new generation alongside established stars ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-norway-announces-the-names-of-its-athletes-for-the-start-of-the-skiathlon-and-classic-sprint-events-0205/)). Her Olympic debut at Milano Cortina 2026 was marked by an excellent 4th-place finish in the Sprint Classic final — just missing the podium in a highly competitive race ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/)). Days before the Olympics, she and Astrid Øyre Slind teamed to finish second in the World Cup Team Sprint Free in Goms on January 23, 2026, earning her first World Cup podium ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/gimmler-and-rydzek-boost-germany-s-olympic-hopes-with-goms-team-sprint-win)). The pairing of the experienced distance powerhouse Slind with the explosive sprint talent of Drivenes gives Norway a balanced and dangerous team sprint combination. In November 2025, Drivenes won a skate sprint race in Beitostølen ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-beitostolen-julie-bjervig-drivenes-wins-by-a-whisker-ahead-of-karoline-simpson-larsen-in-the-individual-skate-delphine-claudel-fifteenth-1123/)). Her rapid ascent to Olympic level sprint competition in her first Games underscores her potential as a future Norwegian sprint star.

## Personal Background
Julie Bjervig Drivenes was born September 23, 1999 and grew up in the Oslo Fjord region of Norway ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=208168&type=result)). She previously competed for Lommedalens IL before joining the Elon Oslofjord regional team and then Team Konnerud. She experienced a difficult period with injury and illness before her "renaissance" in Beitostølen in November 2025, where she won the skate sprint — a result she described as a turning point: ["I would never have reached my current level without these difficult moments."](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-i-would-never-have-reached-my-current-level-without-these-difficult-moments-julie-bjervig-drivenes-renaissance-in-beitostolen-1123/) ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-beitostolen-julie-bjervig-drivenes-wins-by-a-whisker-ahead-of-karoline-simpson-larsen-in-the-individual-skate-delphine-claudel-fifteenth-1123/)) Her rapid ascent from regional team athlete to Olympic finalist and World Cup podium finisher in a single season is one of the breakout stories of the 2025-26 campaign.
