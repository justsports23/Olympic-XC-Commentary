## Career Summary
Dinigeer Yilamujiang (also known by her Uyghur name Dilnigar Ilhamjan) is a two-time Olympian and one of China's most prominent cross-country skiing figures ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=225782&type=result)). An ethnic Uyghur from Altay, Xinjiang, she is [the first Chinese cross-country skier to win a medal in an FIS event](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Dinigeer_Yilamujiang) (silver, FIS Beijing Grand Prix, 2019). She became globally known as one of the two final torchbearers who lit the Olympic cauldron at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics opening ceremony, watched by billions worldwide ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2022/02/05/dinigeer-yilamujiang-cauldron-olympic-skiing/)). Altay, Xinjiang has a centuries-old tradition of fur skiing and is considered by many historians as the origin of skiing itself — a cultural heritage Dinigeer represents at the Olympic level. At Beijing 2022 she competed in the skiathlon (43rd) ([Olympics Beijing 2022](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/cross-country-skiing/athlete-profile-n1058586-dinigeer-yilamujiang.htm)). At the 2021 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships she and CHI Chunxue achieved a best of 13th in the Women's Team Sprint Free ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/dinigeer-yilamujiang-cross-country-skiing-spf573677.html)). At the 2025 Trondheim World Championships she placed 55th (10km) and 47th (Sprint), and the Chinese relay team placed 14th ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/dinigeer-yilamujiang-cross-country-skiing-spf573677.html)). At 2026 Milano Cortina she finished 78th in 10km, 53rd in Sprint, 68th in Skiathlon, and was part of the relay team placing 19th ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=225782&type=result)). She also has a [Junior Worlds best of 5th](https://www.the-sports.org/dinigeer-yilamujiang-cross-country-skiing-spf573677.html) (Women's 5km, 2021 season).

## Key Strengths
A versatile all-round skier with experience in sprint, distance, and relay formats. Her best results have come in sprint-related events and team formats. Competes well in freestyle technique events. As an athlete from Xinjiang's skiing culture, she carries significant cultural weight for Chinese cross-country skiing promotion.

## Key Storylines
Dinigeer's role lighting the Olympic cauldron at Beijing 2022 made her one of the most recognizable athletes in China's Olympic history ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2022/02/05/dinigeer-yilamujiang-cauldron-olympic-skiing/)). Her ethnic Uyghur heritage and roots in Altay, where skiing has been practiced for thousands of years, connect her story to the deepest origins of the sport itself. The Washington Post and numerous international outlets covered her torchbearer role ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2022/02/05/dinigeer-yilamujiang-cauldron-olympic-skiing/)). Now at her second Olympics, she continues as one of China's primary sprint hopes. Her Junior Worlds 5th place shows she had genuine junior-level sprint talent ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/dinigeer-yilamujiang-cross-country-skiing-spf573677.html)). The 2021 World Champs 13th in team sprint free with CHI Chunxue remains the strongest result for this Chinese pairing ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/dinigeer-yilamujiang-cross-country-skiing-spf573677.html)).

**Pairing note:** Dinigeer and CHI Chunxue are China's established long-term team sprint pair. CHI brings the veteran experience (three Olympics, World Cup career best 8th); Dinigeer brings the name recognition and demonstrated junior-to-senior sprint trajectory. Their partnership in team sprint goes back to at least 2021.
