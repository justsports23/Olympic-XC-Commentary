## Key Storylines
Eiduka is Latvia's star performer at these Games and one of the stories of the 2026 Olympics cross-country program. Her 15th-place finish in the 10km freestyle on February 12 is the best individual Olympic result ever achieved by a Latvian cross-country skier, as confirmed by LSM national media ([LSM](https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/sport/12.02.2026-patricija-eiduka-sets-latvian-record-in-olympic-cross-country.a634374/)). A three-time Olympian at just 26, she has brought Latvia to a new level of international competitiveness ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patr%C4%ABcija_Eiduka)). She grew up in Vecbebri, a small rural community in central Latvia, and started skiing at age three ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patr%C4%ABcija_Eiduka)). Her father Ingus Eiduks, who was her long-time coach, passed away in November 2021 from COVID-19 — making her subsequent achievements all the more poignant ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patr%C4%ABcija_Eiduka)). She won the FIS U23 green bib (best U23 skier on the World Cup circuit) in 2023-24, signaling her development into a genuine World Cup contender ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/last-seasons-u-23-winner-patricija-eiduka)). A FIS interview prior to the current season noted her ambitions for continued progress at the World Cup level ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2023-24/last-seasons-u-23-winner-patricija-eiduka)). With three Olympic appearances and multiple World Championship entries, she arrives at the team sprint with the most complete resume of any athlete in this Latvia pairing.

**Pairing note:** Eiduka's individual Olympic 15th and World Cup top-5 results make her the highest-performing skier of the entire Latvia pair; Auziņa's team-racing experience ensures Latvia executes the team sprint format efficiently. This is one of the more competitive pairings in the lower seeded bracket.
