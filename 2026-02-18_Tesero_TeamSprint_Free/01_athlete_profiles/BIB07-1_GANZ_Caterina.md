## Key Storylines
Caterina Ganz is competing on home snow in Val di Fiemme, Italy — the region where she competes on home soil and where Italy has always shown strong public support for cross-country skiing ([FIS Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/italy-s-stars-who-will-have-the-olympic-cross-country-on-their-doorstep-we-will-also-use-the-home-pressure-to-go-faster-)). She is 30 years old and in her second Olympics, having built a consistent career as part of Italy's national team since her 2017 World Championship debut ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=175848&type=result)). Her team's fifth-place finish in the Team Sprint Classic at the 2025 World Championships was Italy's best team sprint result in recent years ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-womens-team-sprint/)), and this experience with Iris De Martin Pinter brings proven partnership chemistry. In an FIS interview ahead of the 2026 Olympics, Ganz acknowledged the team event as Italy's best chance for a surprise result: "in the team events, you have more of a possibility that something could happen" ([FIS Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/italy-s-stars-who-will-have-the-olympic-cross-country-on-their-doorstep-we-will-also-use-the-home-pressure-to-go-faster-)). The home crowd factor at Tesero — Italy's cross-country ski stadium — gives the Italian duo extra motivation. The pairing of Ganz's distance endurance with De Martin Pinter's sprint explosiveness mirrors how many top teams construct their team sprint partnerships ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-italy-unveils-its-sprint-skate-team-with-a-royal-mens-duo-0216/)). Italy has never won an Olympic medal in the women's team sprint but views this as an opportunity ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/olympics-2026-complete-guide-to-the-womens-team-sprint/)).

## Personal Background
Caterina Ganz was born November 13, 1995 in Moena — a town in the Val di Fassa area of Trentino, Italy, just over the mountain pass from the Tesero venue ([FIS Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/italy-s-stars-who-will-have-the-olympic-cross-country-on-their-doorstep-we-will-also-use-the-home-pressure-to-go-faster-)). Her home in Moena puts the Olympic cross-country course at Tesero approximately 10 minutes away by car, making this a true home race. In a FIS pre-Olympics interview, she reflected on the privilege of competing on home soil: "We will use the home pressure to go faster" ([FIS Interview](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/italy-s-stars-who-will-have-the-olympic-cross-country-on-their-doorstep-we-will-also-use-the-home-pressure-to-go-faster-)). She has been a member of the Italian national team since her 2017 World Championship debut and is one of Italy's most experienced active skiers ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/italian-national-teams-for-season-2024-2025/)).
