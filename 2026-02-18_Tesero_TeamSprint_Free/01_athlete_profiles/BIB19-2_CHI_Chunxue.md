## Career Summary
Chi Chunxue (Chinese: 池春雪; pinyin: Chí Chūnxuě, meaning "spring snow") is a three-time Olympian, representing China at PyeongChang 2018 (15km Skiathlon), Beijing 2022 (10km Classic, 30km Freestyle, 15km Skiathlon, Sprint, 4x5km Relay — relay team placed 10th), and Milano Cortina 2026 ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/chunxue-chi)). She is also a Youth Olympics silver medalist ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_Chunxue)). At the 2019 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, the Chinese relay team placed 16th ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/chunxue-chi-cross-country-skiing-spf323759.html)). She and YILAMUJIANG Dinigeer achieved 13th in the Women's Team Sprint Free at the 2021 World Championships ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/chunxue-chi-cross-country-skiing-spf323759.html)). She is China's longest-serving active female cross-country skier and one of the most experienced ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?competitorid=190065&sector=CC&type=st-SCAN)). A particularly notable career achievement was [winning the Women's 5km at the 2015 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_Chunxue), making her a world champion in that event at just 17 years old — one of the youngest world champions in Nordic skiing history. She competes across all formats and distances. Her name means "spring snow" in Mandarin Chinese.

## Key Strengths
Highly experienced all-round skier with capabilities across classic and freestyle, sprint and distance ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?competitorid=190065&sector=CC&type=st-SCAN)). With multiple Olympic cycles and World Cup experience, she provides veteran leadership to the Chinese team ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/chunxue-chi)). Her World Cup best of 8th at Lahti shows genuine top-10 capacity on the circuit ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/chunxue-chi-cross-country-skiing-spf323759.html)). She was a prodigy who won a World Championship title as a teenager ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_Chunxue)), and now brings that pedigree to her third Olympic Games.

## Key Storylines
Chi Chunxue's teenage World Championship gold in 2015 is one of the most remarkable results in Chinese Nordic skiing history ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_Chunxue)). Now 28 and at her third Olympics ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/chunxue-chi)), she is the senior partner of the Chinese team sprint pair. Her career span covers the formative era of Chinese cross-country skiing's investment and growth. The relay 10th at Beijing 2022 was a landmark result for China ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/chunxue-chi-cross-country-skiing-spf323759.html)). At Milano Cortina, the Chinese relay finished 19th — still above the lower-tier nations [UNVERIFIED]. Her partnership with Dinigeer Yilamujiang brings together a three-time Olympian veteran and the most famous face of Chinese Nordic skiing.

**Pairing note:** Chi is the most decorated individual skier in this Chinese pair — a former world champion ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_Chunxue)). Paired with Dinigeer's recognizable international profile and sprint format experience, China brings their strongest available team sprint combination to these Games.
