## Career Summary
Konstantina Charalampidou is making her first Olympic appearance at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games. A [biathlete as well as cross-country skier](https://www.biathlonworld.com/athlete/charalampidou-konstantina/BTGRE21307200201), she competes in both disciplines at the international level. She grew up in Drama, a city in northern Greece near the Bulgarian border, and began skiing at age 15 at the Falakro ski resort — one of Greece's highest ski areas, located at 2,232m elevation in the Xanthi regional unit. She represented Greece at the [2020 Lausanne Winter Youth Olympics](https://www.pulse-z.eu/quality-over-quantity-meet-the-greek-delegation-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/) (89th in 6km sprint, 90th in 10km race) and at Beijing 2022. At the 2024 Biathlon World Championships, she and Apostolos Angelis formed the [first Greek team ever to compete in a relay event at a Biathlon World Championship](https://en.sportnews.bz/artikel/wintersport/biathlon/exotin-in-antholz-aus-griechenlands-sonne-in-die-loipe) (Single Mixed Relay, 27th). At the 2026 Olympics she finished 86th in the Women's 10km Freestyle. She and TITA Nefeli achieved 26th in the Women's Team Sprint Classic at the 2025 World Championships. Her Junior Worlds best is 84th. She studies medicine at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, balancing elite athletic training with one of the most demanding academic programs in Greece.

## Key Strengths
A versatile dual-sport (cross-country/biathlon) athlete bringing endurance from both disciplines to the team sprint format. Her biathlon background adds shooting discipline and controlled racing technique to her overall athletic profile. Beginning skiing at 15 — relatively late — and reaching Olympic level underscores strong natural athleticism and effective coaching at Falakro. Together with TITA Nefeli she forms Greece's most experienced active cross-country pair.

## Key Storylines
Charalampidou's dual identity as a medical student and Olympic athlete reflects the broader challenge of Greek winter sports — a smaller talent pool means athletes must be multi-disciplinary and highly self-motivated. Her late start to skiing at age 15 at Falakro, combined with reaching two Olympic Games, is remarkable. The 2024 Biathlon World Championships relay appearance — Greece's first ever at a Biathlon Worlds — is a historic achievement she shares with Apostolos Angelis. Her 26th in team sprint at the 2025 Worlds with Tita gives Greece their best recent team sprint result.

**Pairing note:** Charalampidou's biathlon background adds endurance and disciplined race control; Tita's flag-bearing status and stronger individual FIS points make Tita the senior performer. Together they are Greece's strongest available cross-country pair.
