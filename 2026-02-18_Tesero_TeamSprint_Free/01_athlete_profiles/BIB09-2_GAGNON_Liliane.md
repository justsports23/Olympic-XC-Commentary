## Key Storylines
First Olympic Games ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/liliane-gagnon/)). Born in Shawinigan-Sud, Quebec, Gagnon is one of Canada's most promising young cross-country skiers ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liliane_Gagnon)). She participated in the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games before graduating to the senior World Cup circuit ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liliane_Gagnon)). As a three-time medallist at FIS U23 World Championships — including gold in the mixed relay (2024) and two bronze medals in 2025 ([TSN](https://www.tsn.ca/skiing/canadian-cross-country-skier-liliane-gagnon-earns-world-under-23-bronze-medal-1.2248055)) — she arrives at her first senior Olympics with strong international credentials. The combination of Gagnon and Alison Mackie in the team sprint leverages the momentum from their breakthrough 2025-26 season, where both have demonstrated podium-level ability in World Cup competition ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/2026/02/13/breakthrough-olympic-games-continue-for-young-canadian-cross-country-skiers/)). Competes out of Shawinigan-Sud, Quebec.

## Personal Background
Liliane Gagnon was born December 15, 2002 in Shawinigan-Sud, a town in Mauricie region of Quebec — Canada's French-speaking heartland ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liliane_Gagnon)). She brings a Francophone-Quebec background to Canadian skiing and is one of very few Quebec-origin athletes at the top of Canadian cross-country skiing. Her favorite quote, per Team Canada, is "En cas de doute, gaz au boute" (When in doubt, go all out) — a very Quebec expression reflecting her aggressive racing mentality ([Team Canada](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/liliane-gagnon/)). She participated in the 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games before graduating to the senior World Cup circuit and Olympic stage ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liliane_Gagnon)).
