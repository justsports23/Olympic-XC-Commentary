## Career Summary
Ieva Dainyte is a two-time Olympian representing Lithuania, having competed at both the 2022 Beijing and 2026 Milano Cortina Games ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/ieva-dainyte)). She was [the youngest Lithuanian athlete at Beijing 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ieva_Dainyt%C4%97), competing alongside SAVICKAITE Egle. The name Ieva (from the Lithuanian name for the bird cherry tree, Prunus padus) is the Lithuanian equivalent of Eve. At Beijing 2022 she finished 91st (10km), 86th (Sprint), and [23rd in the Women's Team Sprint Classic](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/cross-country-skiing/athlete-profile-n1041785-ieva-dainyte.htm) with SAVICKAITE. At the 2021 World Championships she finished 97th in the sprint ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=258252)). At the 2025 World Championships, she was part of Lithuania's relay team that achieved 15th in the Women's 4 x 5km Relay ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=258252)). She has competed at three FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in total ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=258252)). Her Junior Worlds best is 17th (recorded twice) [UNVERIFIED]. She and SAVICKAITE are Lithuania's established long-term team sprint pairing.

## Key Strengths
A sprint and relay specialist who has developed alongside SAVICKAITE as part of the Lithuanian long-term program ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=258252)). Her consistent Olympic and World Championship appearances across three events demonstrate reliability ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/ieva-dainyte)). At 21 she is still developing and her performance ceiling has not yet been reached. Her Junior Worlds best of 17th (twice) shows genuine junior-level sprint aptitude [UNVERIFIED].

## Key Storylines
As the younger of the two Lithuanian partners — born February 24, 2005 — Dainyte was technically the youngest Lithuanian athlete at Beijing 2022 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ieva_Dainyt%C4%97)). Now 21, she is still young but returning for her second Olympic Games as an established team sprint specialist ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/ieva-dainyte)). The partnership's 23rd at Beijing was built on shared experience and familiarity ([Olympics Beijing 2022](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/cross-country-skiing/athlete-profile-n1041785-ieva-dainyte.htm)), and both athletes have now trained together for a full additional Olympic cycle. Lithuania's relay 15th at the 2025 Worlds confirms the program continues to develop ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=258252)).

**Pairing note:** Dainytė and Savickaitė are symmetric in age (both 21), experience, and career stage — an unusual pairing in that neither is clearly the senior or junior athlete. Their shared development arc from Youth Olympics through two senior Games makes them one of the most cohesive long-term team sprint partnerships in this field.
