## Career Summary
Eduarda Ribera is a two-time Olympian representing Brazil, having competed at both Beijing 2022 and Milano Cortina 2026. She was one of Brazil's [two teenage Olympic debutants in cross-country skiing at Beijing 2022](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games//en/results/cross-country-skiing/athlete-profile-n1055119-eduarda-ribera.htm), finishing 90th (10km Individual), 88th (Sprint), and 23rd in the Women's Team Sprint Classic with MOURA Bruna. Her family is originally from the state of Rondônia in the Amazon region of western Brazil — one of the most unlikely origins for a world-level cross-country skier. At the 2025 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships she contributed to Brazil's [18th place in the Women's 4 x 7.5km Relay](https://www.the-sports.org/eduarda-ribera-cross-country-skiing-spf633222.html) and achieved [Brazil's best-ever placement in a sprint event with 68th of 121](https://www.olympics.com/pt/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/eduarda-ribera-esqui-cross-country-perfil-biografia-resultados-brasileira-jogos-olimpicos-inverno-milano-cortina-2026). At the 2026 Olympics she finished 72nd (Sprint Classic) but was forced to [withdraw during the 10km Freestyle after experiencing a medical issue at 4.9km](https://www.olympics.com/pt/milano-cortina-2026/noticias/eduarda-ribera-esqui-cross-country-recuperacao-mal-estar). She subsequently recovered in time for the team sprint. Her World Cup best of 14th at Livigno is a remarkable result for Brazilian cross-country skiing.

## Key Strengths
A genuine World Cup performer with a 14th place finish at Livigno, representing the highest level of international competition among Brazilian women. Strong sprint and team formats. Still young at 21 with significant upside. Her recovery from the 10km DNF in time to compete in the team sprint demonstrates resilience and physical durability.

## Key Storylines
Ribera is Brazil's primary individual cross-country racing hope — her 14th at Livigno stands as one of the finest results in Brazilian Nordic skiing history. Her family's roots in Rondônia, the Amazon state, add an extraordinary geographic dimension to her story. Her medical withdrawal from the 10km at these Games was covered by Olympics.com Portugal, who confirmed her subsequent recovery. The team sprint on February 18 is her opportunity to complete a full Games despite the setback in the 10km. Her partnership with Bruna Moura — one of the great human interest stories in Olympic sport — makes the Brazilian team sprint pair far more than just a sporting result.

**Pairing note:** Ribera is the higher World Cup-ranked of the two Brazilian athletes (14th vs. Moura's 61st) and the primary competitive engine. Moura's veteran experience and extraordinary resilience story complements Ribera's youth and genuine World Cup results. Together they are the most compelling partnership in the field for broadcast storytelling.
