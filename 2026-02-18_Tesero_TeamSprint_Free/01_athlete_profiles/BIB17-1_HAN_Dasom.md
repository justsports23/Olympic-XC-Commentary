## Career Summary
HAN Dasom is a two-time Olympian, representing South Korea at both the 2022 Beijing and 2026 Milano Cortina Games ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42870)). At Beijing 2022, she and teammate LEE Eui Jin finished 22nd in the Women's Team Sprint Classic ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162284&type=result)). At the 2025 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, the Korean team sprint pair achieved their best World Champs result of 17th in the Women's Team Sprint Classic ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162284&type=result)). At the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics, HAN was [disqualified from the Women's Sprint Classic qualification round](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-two-south-korean-cross-country-skiers-disqualified-for-having-fluoride-on-their-skis-0210/) after her equipment tested positive for fluorinated wax, a substance banned since the 2023/24 season; the Korea Ski Association disputed the finding ([Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2-south-korean-skiers-disqualified-from-olympics-over-banned-substance-equipment)). She subsequently finished 80th in the Women's 10km Freestyle ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42870)). Ranked 157th in the World Cup at the time of the Games [UNVERIFIED]. HAN is one of the most experienced South Korean cross-country skiers, having competed at the World Cup level for over a decade ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162284&type=result)).

## Key Strengths
An all-round distance skier with experience across multiple Olympic cycles. Teams well with LEE Eui Jin in relay and team sprint formats, having competed together through multiple World Championships and Olympic campaigns. At 31 she is the senior partner of the South Korean team sprint pair.

## Key Storylines
The fluorinated wax disqualification at the sprint qualifier is the defining storyline for the Korean pair at these Games ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-two-south-korean-cross-country-skiers-disqualified-for-having-fluoride-on-their-skis-0210/)). Both HAN and LEE were flagged, and the Korea Ski Association disputed the results, but the DSQs stood ([Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2-south-korean-skiers-disqualified-from-olympics-over-banned-substance-equipment)). The team sprint on February 18 represents their opportunity for redemption and to demonstrate their true competitive form. Their 17th at the 2025 World Championships shows genuine capability at the major championship level ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=162284&type=result)).

**Pairing note:** HAN is the veteran of the Korean pair, with two Olympic cycles and multiple World Championships. Her experience steadies the partnership; LEE brings youth and the benefit of Fischer equipment (verified). Together they have steadily improved their team sprint result at each major championship.
