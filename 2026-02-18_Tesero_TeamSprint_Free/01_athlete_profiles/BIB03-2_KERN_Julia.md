## Key Storylines
Julia Kern grew up in Waltham, Massachusetts (graduated Waltham High School) and was born in Berkeley, California ([Waltham Times](https://walthamtimes.org/2026/02/01/waltham-high-school-graduate-cross-country-skier-julia-kern-heads-to-her-second-olympics-games/)). She is a consistent high performer in team events, having won back-to-back World Championship medals in the team sprint with Jessie Diggins in 2023 (bronze, free) and 2025 (silver, classic) ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=181770&type=result)). At Milano Cortina 2026, she was the lone American in the women's sprint classic final, finishing 6th — an impressive result ([NBC Bay Area](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/berkeley-julia-kern-cross-country-sprint/4031977/)). Her pairing with Diggins in the team sprint is their fourth major championship team sprint appearance together. Kern also serves as one of the FIS Athlete Liaisons within the federation, demonstrating her commitment to the sport beyond competition ([Team USA](https://www.teamusa.com/profiles/julia-kern-1084949)). With Diggins retiring after this season, the team sprint will carry extra emotional significance. Kern's role in the pairing is to provide the finishing sprint speed on the final exchange, while Diggins handles the distance legs with her superior endurance engine. Their chemistry from multiple championship races together is a key strength.
