## Career Summary
Nahiara Diaz Gonzalez is a two-time Olympian representing Argentina, having competed at both Beijing 2022 and Milano Cortina 2026 ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/nahiara-diaz-gonzalez)). At Beijing 2022 she and her partner finished 23rd in the Women's Team Sprint Classic ([Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/147813)). She has competed at two FIS Nordic World Ski Championships; at the 2023 Planica World Championships, the Argentine team sprint pair achieved [20th place in the Women's Team Sprint Free](https://www.olympiandatabase.com/index.php?id=305391&L=1) -- Argentina's best-ever World Champs team sprint result. She also finished 80th in the Women's Sprint Classic at the 2026 Olympics ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=CC&competitorid=240732&type=fispoints)). At the 2023 South American Cup, she [won both days of the first weekend](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/south-american-cup-2023-first-weekend-recap/), demonstrating her regional dominance. Her Junior Worlds best is 19th [UNVERIFIED]. Diaz Gonzalez trains in Buenos Aires and accesses snow in the Andes for competitive seasons, typical of Argentina's national cross-country team setup [UNVERIFIED].

## Key Strengths
Argentina's leading cross-country skiing figure alongside GROETZNER ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/nahiara-diaz-gonzalez)). Her South American Cup victories demonstrate clear dominance at the continental level ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/south-american-cup-2023-first-weekend-recap/)), and her team sprint experience provides the core of Argentina's pairing. Better performance in team formats than individual World Cup events.

## Key Storylines
Diaz Gonzalez has quickly become one of the faces of Argentine cross-country skiing ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/nahiara-diaz-gonzalez)). South American cross-country skiers typically train at altitude in the Patagonian Andes and spend winters in Europe to accumulate race starts. Her Junior Worlds 19th [UNVERIFIED] and South American Cup wins ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/south-american-cup-2023-first-weekend-recap/)) show she is among the strongest skiers from the Southern Hemisphere in this sport. Argentina's 20th at the 2023 World Champs in team sprint is the benchmark result for this pairing ([Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/147813)). The 2026 Olympics represent her third major championship.

**Pairing note:** Díaz González as the more established team sprint specialist pairs with Groetzner, who brings Patagonian altitude training and Youth Olympics experience. Together they are Argentina's best team sprint combination, built through repeated pairing at World Championships.
