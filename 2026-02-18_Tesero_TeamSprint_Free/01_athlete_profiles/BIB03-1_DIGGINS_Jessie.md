## Key Storylines
Jessie Diggins is the most decorated cross-country skier in US history and is competing in her final season before retirement ([US Ski & Snowboard](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/one-final-season-jessie-diggins-announces-retirement-following-end-2025-26-season)). She announced before the 2025-26 season that she will retire after the March 2026 Lake Placid finals ([US Ski & Snowboard](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/one-final-season-jessie-diggins-announces-retirement-following-end-2025-26-season)). Her legacy: 4 Olympic medals, 7 World Championship medals, 3 World Cup overall titles, and 29 individual World Cup wins ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=146768)). She won the Tour de Ski for the third time in January 2026 before heading to the Olympics ([SnowBrains](https://snowbrains.com/u-s-cross-country-skier-jessie-diggins-wins-tour-de-ski-for-the-3rd-time/)). At Milano Cortina 2026, she suffered bruised ribs from a crash during an early race (possibly skiathlon) but still fought to 8th in the skiathlon before winning bronze in the 10km freestyle ([US Ski & Snowboard](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/diggins-wins-fourth-olympic-medal-bronze-10k-skate)). The pairing with Julia Kern in the team sprint is a reunion of their 2023 and 2025 World Championship bronze/silver team sprint partnership ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=146768)). Diggins brings distance endurance and tactical IQ; Kern provides sprint speed. This is likely Diggins' final race at an Olympic Games, adding emotional weight to the competition ([Powder.com](https://www.powder.com/news/jessie-diggins-skier-milan-cortina-2026)). Her team sprint performances at World Championships (3 medals) make USA a legitimate dark horse for a medal at Tesero.

## Personal Background
Jessie Diggins was born August 16, 1991 in Afton, Minnesota — a small town in Washington County in the St. Croix River Valley ([US Ski & Snowboard](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/athletes/jessie-diggins)).

She earned a bachelor's degree through her athletic career years [UNVERIFIED]. She announced she will retire after the 2025-26 season, concluding at the Lake Placid World Cup in March 2026 — making all her events at Milano Cortina 2026 among the last of her career ([US Ski & Snowboard](https://www.usskiandsnowboard.org/news/one-final-season-jessie-diggins-announces-retirement-following-end-2025-26-season)).
