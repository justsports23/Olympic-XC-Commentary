## Career Summary
Sofiia Shkatula is making her first Olympic appearance at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=271084)). One of the youngest athletes in the women's field, she was born in 2007 and is 18 years old. She has competed at one FIS Nordic World Ski Championships; at the 2025 Trondheim World Championships, she and NIKON Anastasiia contributed to [Ukraine's 15th place finish in the Women's 4 x 7.5km Relay](https://www.the-sports.org/sofiia-shkatula-cross-country-skiing-spf787905.html). At the 2024 Nordic Junior World Ski Championships she placed 63rd in the 10km Individual and 65th in the Sprint ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/sofiia-shkatula-cross-country-skiing-spf787905.html)). At 2026 Milano Cortina she finished 64th in the Sprint qualifier (not qualifying for finals), 67th in the Skiathlon, and 69th in the 10km Individual ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=271084)). Her family home in eastern Ukraine's Sumy region was [destroyed during the ongoing conflict](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/ukrainian-skier-tears-competing-against-144327371.html), adding deep personal context to her Olympic journey. A [Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/ukrainian-skier-tears-competing-against-144327371.html) report covered her emotional story of competing at the Olympics against the backdrop of displacement and loss.

## Key Strengths
A young distance-oriented skier still developing in the sprint format. Her Goms World Cup result of 19th indicates growing capacity, particularly in distance/mass start style events. Competes in 10km, Skiathlon, Sprint, and Relay formats. At 18 she is one of the youngest Olympians in the women's cross-country field.

## Key Storylines
Shkatula's personal story is among the most emotionally resonant at these Games. Her home in Sumy, eastern Ukraine — near the Russian border — was destroyed in the conflict, displacing her family ([Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/ukrainian-skier-tears-competing-against-144327371.html)). Yahoo Sports reported her emotional response when competing in events that placed her alongside athletes from Russia (competing as Individual Neutral Athletes) ([Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/ukrainian-skier-tears-competing-against-144327371.html)). Despite this context, she has continued training and competing at the highest level, making her Olympic debut at 18 ([Glavnoe](https://glavnoe.in.ua/en/news-en/ukraine-names-its-cross-country-and-skiing-team-for-the-2026-winter-olympics)). Her World Cup best of 19th at Goms shows she is developing genuine international competitiveness [UNVERIFIED].

**Pairing note:** At 18, Shkatula is the youngest in this Ukrainian pair. Her Olympic debut alongside Nikon represents Ukraine's investment in its youngest generation of skiers. The depth of personal sacrifice behind their participation gives this pairing a unique emotional dimension.
