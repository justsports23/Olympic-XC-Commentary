## Key Storylines
Coletta Rydzek is the explosive sprint finisher that gives Germany's team sprint pairing with Laura Gimmler its winning edge. She came from a Nordic combined family — her brother Johannes Rydzek is a world-champion Nordic combined skier [UNVERIFIED] — and has developed into one of Germany's top sprint talents. Her breakthrough came on March 21, 2025, when she won the Sprint Free in Lahti, Finland, denying Kristine Stavås Skistad a third consecutive Lahti win in the final meters ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/rydzek-claims-maiden-world-cup-win-in-season-s-last-sprint)). FIS described her as claiming her maiden win with "dream performance" ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/rydzek-claims-maiden-world-cup-win-in-season-s-last-sprint)). She was ranked 9th in sprint standings heading to the Olympics ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=180750&type=result)). At the Olympic sprint classic in Milano Cortina, she placed 8th in the final — her best Olympic result to date ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=180750&type=result)). Together with Gimmler, they won the Team Sprint Free in Goms on January 23, 2026, the clearest pre-Olympic signal that Germany is a genuine medal contender ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/gimmler-and-rydzek-boost-germany-s-olympic-hopes-with-goms-team-sprint-win)). Her role in the team sprint is the closing sprint specialist — providing explosive speed in the final laps of the free technique format. FIS called her a "Bavarian Export" with a fun video feature about her personality ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/video/2026-01/coletta-rydzek-bavarian-export-nordic-skier-and-secret-alpine-gossip-broker-134368429943613)).

## Personal Background
Coletta Rydzek was born June 6, 1997 in Oberstdorf, Bavaria — the same town as her SC Oberstdorf teammate Laura Gimmler ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=180750&type=result)). Her brother Johannes Rydzek is a multiple World Champion in Nordic combined, making the Rydzek name one of the most celebrated in German Nordic skiing [UNVERIFIED]. Growing up in this family and community environment provided Coletta with exceptional exposure to elite Nordic athletics. The FIS produced a feature video calling her "Bavarian Export, Nordic Skier, and Secret Alpine Gossip Broker" — a playful reference to her Oberstdorf roots and the community connections between cross-country and alpine skiing ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/video/2026-01/coletta-rydzek-bavarian-export-nordic-skier-and-secret-alpine-gossip-broker-134368429943613)). Her surname "Rydzek" has Polish origins (the family name is of Polish-German heritage); the German pronunciation follows German phonetics rather than Polish [UNVERIFIED].
