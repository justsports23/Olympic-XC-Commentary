## Key Storylines
Nadja Kälin is Switzerland's great distance skiing hope, a 24-year-old from St. Moritz who trains at altitude and has shown rapid development ([Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/index/nadja-kaelin-is-switzerlands-greatest-hope-in-the-skiathlon-3084952.html)). Her 4th-place finish in the Olympic skiathlon at Milano Cortina was the biggest result of her career — she nearly won bronze, missing out by just over 25 seconds to Therese Johaug [UNVERIFIED exact margin]. Swiss media were "dazzled" by the result ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-switzerland-dazzled-by-nadja-kaelins-fourth-place-in-the-skiathlon-0207/)). At the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim, she finished 6th in the skiathlon, which was previously her career best at a major championship ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2024-25/kaelin-sui-stole-skiathlon-show-with-sixth-place-surprise-it-is-my-best-race-for-sure-)). She represents Alpina St. Moritz and brings alpine climbing power to the Swiss team ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=210291)). In the team sprint, Kälin pairs with Nadine Fähndrich — a partnership that combines Kälin's distance engine with Fähndrich's proven sprint speed. Kälin's strong form in the Olympic venue of Tesero (having just raced the skiathlon there) gives Switzerland valuable course knowledge heading into the team sprint ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/48454)).

## Personal Background
Nadja Kälin was born April 20, 2001 in the Upper Engadine region of Graubünden, Switzerland — the high-altitude alpine canton where St. Moritz is located. She and her younger sister Marina Kälin (also a professional cross-country skier, two years younger) both grew up skiing in the Engadine and have relocated their main training base to Davos in recent years to be closer to the Swiss national squad and benefit from the snow farming infrastructure there. [Source: [Bluewin.ch / Südostschweiz](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/a-real-home-world-cup-for-sisters-marina-and-nadja-kaelin-2532947.html)] Her father, [DATA NOT FOUND], and family background in the alpine environment gave her an early connection to the skiing world. The Davos World Cup each December is effectively a home race for the Kälin sisters.
