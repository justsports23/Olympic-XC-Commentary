## Career Summary
Sara Ponya is a two-time Olympian representing Hungary, competing at Beijing 2022 and again at Milano Cortina 2026 ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/sara-ponya)). Born in Esztergom on 14 May 1999, she qualified for Beijing 2022 despite a difficult preparation that included [knee surgery and a COVID-19 infection weeks before the Games](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/hungarian-cross-country-skiing-team-confirmed-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/). Alongside cross-country skiing, she is a decorated biathlete, having been named [Hungary's biathlete of the year five times (2019-2023)](https://dailynewshungary.com/hottest-hungarian-athletes-to-watch-at-the-2026-milano-cortina-winter-olympics/) and cross-country skier of the year in 2019 ([Daily News Hungary](https://dailynewshungary.com/hottest-hungarian-athletes-to-watch-at-the-2026-milano-cortina-winter-olympics/)). She represented Hungary at the 2025 Trondheim World Championships, finishing 64th (10km Classical) and 87th (Sprint) as the top Hungarian finisher in both ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=216462&type=result)). In the 2026 Olympics she finished 77th in the Women's Sprint Classic ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=216462&type=result)). She and LACZKO Lara Vanda achieved a best of 24th in the Women's Team Sprint Classic at the 2025 World Championships ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=216462&type=result)).

## Key Strengths
A dual-sport athlete (cross-country and biathlon) with stamina and endurance as core strengths ([IBU Profile](https://www.biathlonworld.com/athlete/ponya-sara/BTHUN21405199901)). Better in classic technique than freestyle. Her experience across two Olympic cycles makes her the steadying presence in the Hungarian team sprint pair ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/sara-ponya)). Her biathlon background adds disciplined race execution and controlled pace management.

## Key Storylines
Ponya's five biathlon-of-the-year titles in Hungary (2019-2023) underscore her status as one of Hungary's most decorated winter athletes ([Daily News Hungary](https://dailynewshungary.com/hottest-hungarian-athletes-to-watch-at-the-2026-milano-cortina-winter-olympics/)). Her story of qualifying for Beijing 2022 after knee surgery and COVID-19 in the lead-up showed remarkable determination ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/hungarian-cross-country-skiing-team-confirmed-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)). At the 2025 Worlds, finishing 64th in the 10km as Hungary's top finisher reflects the relative standing of the program internationally ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=216462&type=result)), but the team sprint 24th — achieved together with Laczko — is a meaningful combined result. Her 77th in the sprint qualifier at the 2026 Olympics tells the story: Ponya is more distance and classic-oriented than a pure sprint specialist.

**Pairing note:** Ponya provides the steady veteran presence with two Olympic cycles and biathlon-grade discipline; Laczko adds youth and energy. Hungary's 24th at the 2025 World Champs in team sprint is the benchmark for this pair's realistic ceiling.
