## Key Storylines
Jonna Sundling is widely regarded as the greatest sprint skier of her generation and one of the most decorated in the sport's history ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/jonna-sundling-darling-of-swedish-sport-exclusive-interview-winter-olympics)). She has won the World Championship sprint gold in three consecutive editions (2021, 2023, 2025) — a remarkable triple in both classic and free technique ([Sweden Herald](https://swedenherald.com/article/sundling-wins-third-consecutive-world-championship-gold)). At Beijing 2022, she won gold in the individual sprint classic ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/jonna-sundling-wins-gold-in-womens-cross-country-sprint)). At Milano Cortina 2026, she added a silver in the individual sprint classic (behind Linn Svahn) and a silver in the relay, continuing Sweden's total dominance of women's sprint skiing ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/sweden-storms-to-sprint-gold-silver-and-bronze-at-milano-cortina-2026/)). Sundling made headlines in January 2026 when she received the prestigious Swedish Jerring Award — given by popular vote to the best Swedish athlete of the year [UNVERIFIED]. She strategically skipped the Tour de Ski to focus on the Olympic season. Together with Maja Dahlqvist, she forms the most experienced and successful women's team sprint pairing in the world, having won multiple World Championship titles together ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/jonna-sundling-sweden-team-sprint-classic-jessie-diggins-usa)). Their chemistry and tactical understanding make them the clear gold medal favorites at Tesero.

## Personal Background
Jonna Sundling was born December 28, 1994 in Piteå, a coastal city in northern Sweden (Norrbotten County), and still represents Piteå Elit SK ([FIS Athlete Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=168267&type=result)). Growing up in Sweden's far north, she developed into a youth prodigy before becoming the dominant force in women's sprint skiing globally. She is managed by Håkanson United ([Håkanson United](https://hakansonunited.se/athletes/jonna-sundling/)). In January 2026, she won the Swedish Jerring Award — the most prestigious Swedish sports prize, voted on by the public — for the second time, reflecting her status as Sweden's most celebrated active athlete [UNVERIFIED]. She is reported to be in a relationship but has kept personal life details private.
