## Career Summary
LEE Eui Jin is a two-time Olympian representing South Korea at both the 2022 Beijing and 2026 Milano Cortina Games ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/42872)). At Beijing 2022, she and HAN Dasom finished 22nd in the Women's Team Sprint Classic ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=221223&type=result)). At the 2025 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, the pair recorded their best World Champs result of 17th in the Women's Team Sprint Classic ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=221223&type=result)). At the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics, LEE was [disqualified from the Women's Sprint Classic qualification round](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-two-south-korean-cross-country-skiers-disqualified-for-having-fluoride-on-their-skis-0210/) after her equipment tested positive for fluorinated wax; she and HAN are ranked 157th and 158th in the World Cup respectively [UNVERIFIED]. LEE subsequently completed the 10km Freestyle, [finishing 73rd with a time of 27:35.09](https://www.starnewskorea.com/en/sports/2026/02/12/2026021223322079589).

## Key Strengths
A younger member of the Korean national team with experience in sprint and distance formats. Her partnership with HAN Dasom gives the Korean team sprint pair accumulated racing experience across multiple major championships. At 24 she is still developing and may have her best results ahead of her.

## Key Storylines
Like HAN, LEE's Olympic experience at these Games was marked by the fluorinated wax disqualification in the sprint qualifier ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-two-south-korean-cross-country-skiers-disqualified-for-having-fluoride-on-their-skis-0210/)). Having qualified her country for the team sprint alongside HAN, the February 18 event is their primary chance at a clean result. Their partnership has been consistent across two Olympic Games and multiple World Championships ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=221223&type=result)). The 17th-place team sprint at the 2025 Worlds shows meaningful development compared to their 22nd at Beijing 2022 ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=221223&type=result)).

**Pairing note:** LEE is the younger and ascending partner to HAN's veteran presence. Fischer equipment (confirmed from [FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=221223&type=result)) gives her a ski brand with well-established team sprint credentials. Their shared experience of the DSQ controversy may motivate a strong combined effort in the team sprint.
