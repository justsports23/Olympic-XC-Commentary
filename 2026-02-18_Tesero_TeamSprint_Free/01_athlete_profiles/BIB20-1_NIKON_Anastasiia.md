## Career Summary
Anastasiia Nikon is making her first Olympic appearance at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games, representing Ukraine ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=238362&type=result)). She has competed at two FIS Nordic World Ski Championships; at the 2025 Trondheim World Championships, she and teammate SHKATULA Sofiia helped Ukraine to a [15th place finish in the Women's 4 x 7.5km Relay](https://www.the-sports.org/sofiia-shkatula-cross-country-skiing-spf787905.html). At the 2026 Olympics, she posted the [best result among Ukrainian skiers in the sprint qualifier with 59th place (4:07.37)](https://mezha.net/eng/bukvy/ukrainian-cross-country-skiers-miss-sprint-qualification-at-2026-olympics/), not advancing to the finals. She also competed in the 10km Interval Start at the Games ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=238362&type=result)). As of the 2025/26 season she ranked approximately 20th in the FIS Cup standings [UNVERIFIED]. Her World Cup best of 9th at Toblach represents a notable individual sprint result for an athlete from Ukraine's current generation [UNVERIFIED].

## Key Strengths
A sprint-oriented young Ukrainian skier showing upward trajectory. Her FIS Cup standing and Toblach result suggest she is one of the stronger performers in her pairing with SHKATULA for the team sprint. At 22 (born Valentine's Day 2004), she is still developing and represents Ukraine's next generation of sprint talent.

## Key Storylines
Nikon competes for Ukraine at a time when Ukrainian athletes are navigating extraordinary circumstances due to the ongoing conflict in their country ([Glavnoe](https://glavnoe.in.ua/en/news-en/ukraine-names-its-cross-country-and-skiing-team-for-the-2026-winter-olympics)). Her first Olympic appearance follows a consistent World Cup season with results that suggest genuine sprint capability — the 9th at Toblach is the headline result [UNVERIFIED]. She and Shkatula form a young Ukrainian pairing, with the entire team drawing significant emotional support. Ukraine's 15th-place relay at the 2025 Worlds shows the national team's competitive standing despite the challenges faced ([The-Sports.org — Shkatula profile](https://www.the-sports.org/sofiia-shkatula-cross-country-skiing-spf787905.html)).

**Pairing note:** Nikon is the more sprint-experienced of the two, with her 9th at Toblach being the best individual result in the pair. Shkatula's very young age (18, born 2007) means Nikon effectively leads this pairing competitively. Together they represent Ukraine's young, developing team sprint program.
