## Key Storylines
Two-time Olympian competing in her second Games ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9lissa_Gal)). At 2022 Beijing, Gal was part of the French team that finished 10th in the Women's Team Sprint Classic ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9lissa_Gal)). Her experience as a sprint specialist makes her France's anchor partner for Léonie Perry in the 2026 Olympic team sprint ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-mathis-desloges-and-jules-chappaz-in-the-sprint-skate-team-leonie-perry-and-melissa-gal-in-the-womens-team-0217/)). The combination of Gal's experience and Perry's emerging talent gives France a competitive pairing. Their 7th-place finish at the Goms World Cup in January 2026 — just weeks before the Olympics — confirmed the duo's readiness. Gal also reached the quarter-finals at the 2025 Trondheim World Championships individual sprint, demonstrating her individual sprint capabilities ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-trondheim-jonna-sundling-and-maja-dahlqvist-win-the-classic-sprint-team-at-the-worlds-melissa-gal-and-lena-quintin-come-ninth-0305/)).

## Personal Background
Mélissa Gal was born October 26, 1999 in Reignier-Ésery, a commune in Haute-Savoie, France — in the shadow of the Alps near Annecy and Geneva ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9lissa_Gal)). She represents the Reignier club and is one of France's leading sprint specialists. As a two-time Olympian (Beijing 2022, Milano Cortina 2026) ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/45600)), she brings experience and tactical awareness to the French team sprint pairing with the younger Léonie Perry. Her Haute-Savoie background — the alpine region of France — gives her a natural connection to high-altitude training environments.
