## Career Summary
Agustina Groetzner is making her first Olympic appearance at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/agustina-groetzner)). A native of [San Carlos de Bariloche](https://www.the-sports.org/agustina-groetzner-cross-country-skiing-spf633181.html) -- Argentina's premier ski resort town in Patagonia -- she has Youth Olympic experience, having competed at [Lausanne 2020](https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/139048). Bariloche sits at approximately 800m elevation on the shores of Lake Nahuel Huapi in the Patagonian Andes, providing natural training terrain for Nordic skiing. She has competed at two FIS Nordic World Ski Championships ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=231347&type=result)); at the 2023 Planica World Championships, she and DIAZ GONZALEZ achieved 20th in the Women's Team Sprint Free, Argentina's best-ever World Champs team sprint result ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/agustina-groetzner-cross-country-skiing-spf633181.html)). At the 2026 Olympics, she finished 83rd in the Women's Sprint Classic and 92nd in the Women's 10km Individual Freestyle ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=231347&type=result)). Her Junior Worlds best is 75th ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/agustina-groetzner-cross-country-skiing-spf633181.html)). At the 2025 World Championships, she placed 66th in 10km Individual and 76th in Sprint ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/agustina-groetzner-cross-country-skiing-spf633181.html)).

## Key Strengths
An emerging Patagonian skier who trains at altitude in Bariloche ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/agustina-groetzner-cross-country-skiing-spf633181.html)). Her Youth Olympic experience ([Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/139048)) and consistent World Championship appearances alongside DIAZ GONZALEZ suggest she is Argentina's designated team sprint partner for the foreseeable future. Still developing in individual sprint formats. The Bariloche training environment provides natural altitude adaptation benefits.

## Key Storylines
Groetzner's first Olympics at 22 ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/agustina-groetzner)) comes after a Youth Olympics appearance ([Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/139048)) and two World Championships in the team sprint role alongside Diaz Gonzalez. Her Bariloche roots are central to her story -- San Carlos de Bariloche is Argentina's most famous ski destination ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/agustina-groetzner-cross-country-skiing-spf633181.html)), with the Centro Civico and the Nahuel Huapi National Park forming the backdrop to her formative training. Argentina's 20th at the 2023 World Champs in team sprint remains the headline result for this pairing ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/agustina-groetzner-cross-country-skiing-spf633181.html)). Her individual World Champs results (66th in 10km, 76th in sprint at 2025 Trondheim) show she is developing across formats ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/agustina-groetzner-cross-country-skiing-spf633181.html)).

**Pairing note:** Groetzner brings the Patagonian altitude training base and Youth Olympics sprint format experience; Díaz González brings the more established team sprint record. Together they are Argentina's most tested and consistent team sprint combination.
