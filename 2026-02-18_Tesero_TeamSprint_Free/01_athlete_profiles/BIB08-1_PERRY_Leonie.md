## Key Storylines
First Olympic Games. At just 21 years old, Perry became the seventh French woman in history to score an individual top 10 at the Olympic Games with her 10th-place finish in the 10km freestyle on 12 February 2026 ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-leonie-perry-the-seventh-french-woman-to-score-an-individual-top-10-at-the-olympic-games-0212/)). She is from La Bresse in the Vosges region ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9onie_Perry)). She partnered with Melissa Gal to finish 7th in the World Cup team sprint in Goms in January 2026, demonstrating their chemistry as a team ahead of the Olympic team sprint ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-mathis-desloges-and-jules-chappaz-in-the-sprint-skate-team-leonie-perry-and-melissa-gal-in-the-womens-team-0217/)). Perry's rapid rise through the French national program marks her as one of France's emerging stars in cross-country skiing.

## Personal Background
Léonie Perry was born November 4, 2004 in La Bresse, a small commune in the Vosges mountains of northeastern France — one of France's premier cross-country skiing regions ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9onie_Perry)). La Bresse is home to Hohneck Ski and has produced a tradition of Nordic athletes. The Vosges are lower altitude than the Alps but receive substantial snowfall, and the area has developed a strong local skiing culture. Perry's emergence as one of France's top all-around skiers at just 21 years old makes her the centerpiece of France's next generation of XC ski development. Her 10th-place finish at the 2026 Olympic 10km free technique was described by Nordic Mag as making her "the seventh French woman in history to score an individual top-10 at the Olympic Games" — a historic milestone for French women's cross-country skiing ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-leonie-perry-the-seventh-french-woman-to-score-an-individual-top-10-at-the-olympic-games-0212/)).
