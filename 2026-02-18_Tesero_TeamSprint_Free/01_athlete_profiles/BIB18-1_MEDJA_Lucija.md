## Career Summary
Lucija Medja is making her first Olympic appearance at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=249919)). A young Slovenian from club TSK Bled — the historic Bled ski club set in the Julian Alps — she has participated in multiple Nordic Junior World Ski Championships, with her best recorded junior result of [13th place (twice)](https://www.the-sports.org/lucija-medja-cross-country-skiing-spf674736.html) in junior events. At the 2022/2023 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Planica, she competed in her first senior World Championships and registered a best finish of 50th in the Women's 7.5km + 7.5km Skiathlon ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/lucija-medja-cross-country-skiing-spf674736.html)). At the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics, she finished 57th in the Sprint qualifier, 95th in the 10km Freestyle Individual, and was part of the Slovenian relay team that [finished 18th in the Women's 4 x 7.5km Relay](https://www.the-sports.org/lucija-medja-cross-country-skiing-spf674736.html). Still developing at the senior level.

## Key Strengths
A versatile young skier competing across distances and sprint formats. Her participation in relays and team events at the 2026 Games alongside the more experienced MANDELJC Anja suggests she is being developed as part of Slovenia's future team sprint core. TSK Bled provides strong club infrastructure with access to the Pokljuka training plateau, a world-class Nordic training environment.

## Key Storylines
At 21 years old, Medja is one of Slovenia's youngest Olympic representatives in cross-country skiing ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=249919)). Born in December 2004, she grew up training at TSK Bled — one of Slovenia's most prestigious Nordic clubs, located near the famous Lake Bled. Her junior doubles of 13th place show consistent performance at the Junior Worlds level ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/lucija-medja-cross-country-skiing-spf674736.html)). The relay 18th on February 15 gives her valuable course experience at Tesero before the team sprint ([The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/lucija-medja-cross-country-skiing-spf674736.html)). Pairing with veteran Mandeljc provides her with a highly experienced partner who knows what it takes to reach the World Championship team sprint top-10.

**Pairing note:** Medja is the young, developing leg; Mandeljc is the proven World Champs team sprint performer (8th at 2023 Planica Worlds, [The-Sports.org](https://www.the-sports.org/anja-mandeljc-cross-country-skiing-spf375423.html)). Slovenia's pair combines Mandeljc's championship pedigree with Medja's energy and junior-level sprint promise — a classic mentor/student Olympic pairing.
