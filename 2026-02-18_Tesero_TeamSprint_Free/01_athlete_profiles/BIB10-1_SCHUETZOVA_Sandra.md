## Key Storylines
First Olympic Games at age 34 — one of the oldest athletes making her Olympic debut at these Games ([Czech Republic at 2026 Winter Olympics — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic_at_the_2026_Winter_Olympics)). Schuetzova is a veteran Czech national team skier who has been one of the Czech Republic's most consistent distance performers for over a decade ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=122277)). In an interview, she expressed desire to "jump into long-distance skiing completely," suggesting her future competitive direction ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/long-distance/sandra-schutzova-i-would-like-to-jump-into-long-distance-skiing-completely/)). Despite her preference for distance racing, she has been effective in team sprint formats. Her pairing with Katerina Janatova — one of the Czech Republic's top all-around skiers — gives the CZE team a strong foundation. Competed in the women's Skiathlon at the 2019 Seefeld World Championships ([FIS Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=122277)).

## Personal Background
Sandra Schützová (anglicized to Schuetzova) was born October 21, 1991 in Jilemnice — a small town in the Liberec Region (Krkonoše foothills, the "Giant Mountains" area) of what is now the Czech Republic, historically a major center of Nordic skiing in the former Czechoslovakia ([Eurosport](https://www.eurosport.com/cross-country-skiing/sandra-schuetzova_prs78106/person.shtml)). Jilemnice is home to the famous Jilemnice Ski Museum and has produced generations of Czech Nordic skiers. She has been a consistent presence on the Czech national team for over a decade and has developed a parallel interest in long-distance ski marathons (Ski Classics circuit), citing a desire to eventually "jump into long-distance skiing completely" ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/long-distance/sandra-schutzova-i-would-like-to-jump-into-long-distance-skiing-completely/)). Her training included time in Norway to learn from the Norwegian system, which she described as formative ([ProXCskiing](https://www.proxcskiing.com/long-distance/learning-from-norway-pays-off-for-sandra-schutzova/)).
