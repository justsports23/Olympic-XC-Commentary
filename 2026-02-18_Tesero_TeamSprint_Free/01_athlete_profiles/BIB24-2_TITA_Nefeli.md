## Career Summary
Nefeli Tita is a four-time World Championships participant and two-time Olympian, one of Greece's most decorated active cross-country skiers ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=209383)). Introduced to skiing around age four by her father Christos Titas, a ski coach from Florina -- the principal city of the Florina regional unit in northern Greece, near the borders with North Macedonia and Albania, and home to one of Greece's oldest skiing traditions ([PulseZ](https://www.pulse-z.eu/quality-over-quantity-meet-the-greek-delegation-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)) -- she debuted at the [2020 Lausanne Winter Youth Olympic Games](https://olympics.fandom.com/wiki/Nefeli_Tita). At Beijing 2022 she was [18 years old and an Olympic debutant](https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/cross-country-skiing/athlete-profile-n1044601-nefeli-tita.htm), finishing 23rd in the Women's Team Sprint Classic with Maria Ntanou. She carried the [Greek flag at the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony](https://greekcitytimes.com/2026/02/07/greece-opens-nations-parade-at-2026-winter-olympics/), one of Greece's highest athletic honors. At the 2025 World Championships she placed 83rd in the 10km Individual ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=209383)). She and CHARALAMPIDOU achieved 26th in the Women's Team Sprint Classic at the 2025 Worlds and 25th in Team Sprint Free at 2023 Worlds ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=209383)). She is also a medical student in Athens, studying alongside her athletic career ([PulseZ](https://www.pulse-z.eu/quality-over-quantity-meet-the-greek-delegation-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)). Her milestone of achieving 85 FIS points demonstrates a level of technical development uncommon for Greek skiing ([PulseZ](https://www.pulse-z.eu/quality-over-quantity-meet-the-greek-delegation-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)). Her name Nefeli means "cloud" in ancient Greek (from nephele).

## Key Strengths
Greece's most prominent cross-country skier, with consistent performance across four World Championships and now two Olympics ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=209383)). Primarily a distance skier with growing sprint capability. Her milestone of achieving 85 FIS points demonstrates a level of technical development uncommon for Greek skiing ([PulseZ](https://www.pulse-z.eu/quality-over-quantity-meet-the-greek-delegation-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)). Flag bearer honor at the 2026 opening ceremony reflects her standing as one of Greece's leading winter athletes ([Greek City Times](https://greekcitytimes.com/2026/02/07/greece-opens-nations-parade-at-the-2026-winter-olympics/)).

## Key Storylines
Carrying the Greek flag at the opening ceremony of the 2026 Olympics is the defining honor of Tita's career to date ([Greek City Times](https://greekcitytimes.com/2026/02/07/greece-opens-nations-parade-at-the-2026-winter-olympics/)). Florina, where she learned to ski from her father Christos -- a ski coach -- is one of the few areas of Greece with genuine cross-country skiing infrastructure ([PulseZ](https://www.pulse-z.eu/quality-over-quantity-meet-the-greek-delegation-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)). Her father's coaching shaped her technical foundation from a very young age. Being a medical student in Athens while training at Olympic level represents an extraordinary dual commitment ([PulseZ](https://www.pulse-z.eu/quality-over-quantity-meet-the-greek-delegation-for-the-2026-winter-olympics/)). She and Charalampidou represent a generation of Greek cross-country skiers who have raised the bar for what Greek athletes can achieve in this sport. Their 26th at the 2025 Worlds and 25th in team sprint free at 2023 Worlds show steady incremental improvement across the pairing ([FIS Profile](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=209383)).

**Pairing note:** Tita is the senior, better-FIS-pointed partner — flag bearer and four-time World Champs participant. Charalampidou's biathlon dual-sport background adds complementary fitness. Together they are the most internationally recognized Greek cross-country pairing of the current era.
