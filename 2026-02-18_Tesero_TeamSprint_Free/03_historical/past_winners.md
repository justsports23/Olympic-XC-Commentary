### 2018 — PyeongChang (South Korea) — FREE TECHNIQUE

| Place | Nation | Athletes | Time |
|-------|--------|----------|------|
| Gold | United States | Jessie Diggins / Kikkan Randall | [DATA NOT FOUND — official time] |
| Silver | Sweden | Charlotte Kalla / Stina Nilsson | [DATA NOT FOUND — time back] |
| Bronze | Norway | Marit Bjørgen / Maiken Caspersen Falla | [DATA NOT FOUND — time back] |

**Notes:** The most historic result in US cross-country skiing history — the first-ever Olympic gold medal for the United States in cross-country skiing (men's or women's, any discipline). Diggins delivered an extraordinary anchor leg to pass Stina Nilsson in the final meters and secure gold. Kikkan Randall anchored the opening legs. This result is one of the defining moments of Diggins' career and the US program. Sweden's Charlotte Kalla and Stina Nilsson won silver; Norway's legendary Marit Bjørgen anchored the bronze with Maiken Caspersen Falla.

**2026 Olympic connection:** Jessie Diggins (BIB 03-1) won gold at PyeongChang 2018 and is now competing at her third Olympics in this same event. The 2026 team sprint is likely her final Olympic race before retirement.

### 2006 — Turin (Italy) — FREE TECHNIQUE

*The team sprint's Olympic debut.*

| Place | Nation | Athletes | Time |
|-------|--------|----------|------|
| Gold | Sweden | Lina Andersson / Anna Dahlberg | 16:36.9 |
| Silver | Canada | Sara Renner / Beckie Scott | +0:00.6 |
| Bronze | Finland | [DATA NOT FOUND] | [DATA NOT FOUND] |

**Notes:** Sweden won the first-ever Olympic women's team sprint. Canada's pair of Sara Renner and Beckie Scott earned silver — famously aided when Norwegian head coach Bjørnar Håkensmoen lent a pole to Renner after she broke one mid-race. Norway was pushed out of the medals as a result. This act of sportsmanship became one of the most celebrated stories of the 2006 Games and prompted a wave of gifts from Canadian fans to the Norwegian coach.

**2026 venue connection:** The 2006 team sprint was held in Turin — in the same Italian Alps region as the 2026 Games, connecting the Olympic history of this event back to Italy.

## World Championship Women's Team Sprint — All-Time Medal Table (2017–2025)

| Nation | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |
|--------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Sweden | 4 | 1 | 0 | 5 |
| USA | 0 | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| Norway | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 |
| Switzerland | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Slovenia | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Russia/ROC | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Finland | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

**Sweden's dominance:** Four consecutive World Championship Women's Team Sprint Free golds (2021, 2023, 2025 free, 2025 classic), all featuring Jonna Sundling. This is the context for why Sweden is such a heavy favorite in the 2026 Olympic event.

**USA's consistency:** Diggins has been on the World Championship team sprint podium in 2017 (bronze), 2021 (with Kern, 5th), 2023 (with Kern, bronze), 2025 classic (with Kern, silver), and 2025 free (with Kern, silver). No other nation outside Sweden has this level of team sprint consistency.
