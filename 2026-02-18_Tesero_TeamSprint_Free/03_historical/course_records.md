# Course Records — Tesero / Val di Fiemme Cross-Country Stadium
## Women's Sprint Events | Reference Document

---

## Overview

The Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium (Centro Fondo Lago di Tesero / Cross Country and Biathlon Center Fabio Canal) has been significantly renovated for the 2026 Winter Olympics. The sprint course configuration for 2026 uses a 1,585 m loop designed specifically for the Olympic Games. Pre-renovation Tour de Ski sprint courses may have used slightly different layouts, making direct course record comparisons across eras difficult.

**Key caveat:** The sprint loop used for the 2026 Olympic Games is a purpose-designed Olympic sprint circuit that may not be identical in layout to historical Tour de Ski sprint courses at this venue. Any records noted below should be understood in the context of the specific course configuration in use at the time.

### Freestyle Technique Sprint Finals

| Season | Date | Winner | Nation | Time | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| 2026 Olympics | 2026-02-10 | Linn Svahn | SWE | [DATA NOT FOUND — official time pending] | Historic Swedish podium sweep |
| [Earlier seasons at Tesero] | [DATA NOT FOUND] | [DATA NOT FOUND] | — | [DATA NOT FOUND] | — |

**Notes:** The 2026 Olympic Women's Sprint Classic on February 10 produced a Swedish podium sweep (Svahn gold, Sundling silver, Dahlqvist bronze), but this was a **classic technique** event despite the word "Classic" referring to technique, not era. No confirmed women's freestyle individual sprint results at Tesero are available in current sources prior to 2026.

## Women's Team Sprint — Val di Fiemme / Tesero

### World Championship Team Sprint Classic — Tesero 2013

The only prior Women's Team Sprint championship final at Tesero was the **2013 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships Women's Team Sprint Classic**, held February 25, 2013:

| Place | Nation | Athletes | Time |
|-------|--------|----------|------|
| Gold | USA | Kikkan Randall / Jessie Diggins | 20:24.4 |
| Silver | Sweden | Charlotte Kalla / Ida Ingemarsdotter | +0:07.8 |
| Bronze | Finland | Riikka Sarasoja-Lilja / Krista Lahteenmäki | +0:10.9 |

**Course record context:** The 2013 championship team sprint was held in the classic technique on the then-configured sprint loop. Times are not directly comparable to the 2026 Olympic freestyle team sprint due to:
- Different technique (classic vs. freestyle)
- Possible different loop configuration (pre-2026 renovation)
- Different snow and weather conditions

The gold medal time of 20:24.4 (classic technique, 2013) serves as a reference benchmark but not a direct course record for the 2026 freestyle event.
