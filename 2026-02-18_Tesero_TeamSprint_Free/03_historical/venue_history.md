# Venue History: Tesero / Val di Fiemme Cross-Country Stadium

## Overview

The Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium (Centro Fondo Lago di Tesero / Cross Country and Biathlon Center Fabio Canal) in Val di Fiemme, Trentino, Italy is one of the most storied Nordic skiing venues in the world. It has hosted four major elite cross-country competitions — three FIS Nordic World Ski Championships and now the 2026 Winter Olympic Games — making it the Olympic venue with arguably the deepest championship pedigree in cross-country skiing.

The venue sits at approximately 830–985 m elevation along the Lago di Tesero, in the Fiemme valley between Bolzano and Trento. Its 19 km of groomed trails are fed by a sophisticated artificial snowmaking system using water from the Avisio River, guaranteeing competition-quality snow. It was [significantly renovated](https://milanocortina2026.coni.it/en/schedule/venues/impianto/71:Tesero_Cross-Country_Skiing_Stadium.html) for the 2026 Olympics, with redesigned loops for both classic and freestyle disciplines.

## FIS Nordic World Ski Championships

### 1991 — Val di Fiemme (Predazzo/Tesero)

The 1991 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships were the first major championship event at Val di Fiemme and the first Nordic World Championships held south of the Alps — a landmark moment for Italian skiing. Val di Fiemme was awarded hosting rights at an FIS committee meeting in Istanbul in 1988, with the Predazzo ski jumping stadium inaugurated specifically for the event in 1989.

- The women's team sprint event did not yet exist (it was not introduced until the 2000s).
- Notable moments included Jevgeni Redkin winning for the Soviet Union and historic results from Yugoslavia just before the country's dissolution.
- Italy placed in the relay and Nordic combined events, energizing the local fan base.

### 2003 — Val di Fiemme (Predazzo/Tesero)

The 2003 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships were described by FIS President Gian Franco Kasper as a "sunny" event: "There were no clouds in Val di Fiemme from 18th February to 1st March, neither in the sky nor on the organization." Val di Fiemme distinguished itself as the first valley to eco-certify its forests and organized the first Eco-certified Nordic World Ski Championships.

- The women's team sprint event was not yet on the program (introduced to Olympic/World Championship calendars in 2005).
- The event helped establish Val di Fiemme as a model for sustainable championship hosting.
- Norway dominated the cross-country program, with Marit Bjørgen making early World Championship appearances.

### 2013 — Val di Fiemme (Predazzo/Tesero)

The 2013 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships (February 20 – March 3, 2013) marked the third time Val di Fiemme hosted the Nordic Worlds — a distinction unique among World Championship venues at the time. This edition was historic for the 2026 Olympic team sprint field: **Jessie Diggins competed here and won her first major championship gold medal**.

#### Women's Team Sprint Classic — February 25, 2013 (Val di Fiemme)

| Place | Nation | Athletes | Time |
|-------|--------|----------|------|
| Gold | USA | **Kikkan Randall / Jessie Diggins** | 20:24.4 |
| Silver | Sweden | Charlotte Kalla / Ida Ingemarsdotter | +0:07.8 |
| Bronze | Finland | Riikka Sarasoja-Lilja / Krista Lahteenmäki | +0:10.9 |

This was the United States' **first-ever gold medal at a FIS Nordic World Ski Championships** in cross-country skiing — an historic achievement. Diggins lost her left pole during the final climb but continued for approximately 100 meters with only one pole, maintaining the American lead to claim gold.

**2026 connection:** Jessie Diggins (BIB 03-1) won her first-ever World Championship medal on this same course 13 years ago. The 2026 Olympic Women's Team Sprint Free returns to the same stadium.

Also at the 2013 championships, the venue hosted a highly successful Tour de Ski Final Climb on Alpe Cermis, further cementing its reputation as a world-class finish venue.

## Tour de Ski at Val di Fiemme

Val di Fiemme has served as the **final destination of the Tour de Ski** in nearly every edition of the multi-stage race since the event's inception in 2006-07. The Val di Fiemme stages traditionally consist of:

1. **Sprint Stage** (classic or freestyle) — held at the Tesero stadium on the same sprint course used for Olympic sprint events
2. **Pursuit/Mass Start Stage** — a distance race through the valley
3. **The Final Climb on Alpe Cermis** — the iconic mountain finish where competitors ski the alpine course on the Alpe Cermis ski area in Cavalese

The sprint course at Tesero used for Tour de Ski is the same 1,585 m loop used for the 2026 Olympic women's team sprint. Athletes with Tour de Ski experience at Fiemme have significant course familiarity advantage.

## Women's Team Sprint at Tesero: Event-Specific History

The Tesero sprint course has hosted **women's team sprint** competition in the following formats prior to the 2026 Olympics:

- **Tour de Ski** did not include a team sprint stage — the TdS sprint stages are individual events.
- **2013 World Championships** — Women's Team Sprint Classic held at Predazzo/Tesero (see results above).
- **World Cup Team Sprint** events have been held at Fiemme in conjunction with Tour de Ski sprint stages historically, though most World Cup team sprints in this region are scheduled elsewhere.

The 2026 Olympic Women's Team Sprint Free is therefore only the **second time a women's team sprint final has been contested at Tesero** in World Championship or Olympic competition, after 2013.
