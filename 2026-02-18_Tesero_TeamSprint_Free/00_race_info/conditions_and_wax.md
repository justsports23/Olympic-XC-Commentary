## Upcoming Weather: Heavy Snow 19–20 February

A significant snowfall event (forecast ~23 cm at mid-mountain) is predicted to arrive **the day after the Women's Team Sprint** (Thursday, 19 February). This has no direct impact on race conditions on 18 February but may be relevant if any postponement scenario were to arise.

## Wax Recommendations

> **Official wax service reports for 18 February 2026 were not available at time of compilation.** The following is a general guidance framework based on the forecast conditions. Actual team wax choices will be made race morning based on official snow measurements.

**Technique:** Free (skating) — no kick wax required. Glide wax only.

**Estimated conditions and general glide wax guidance:**

| Parameter | Value (Forecast) | Wax Implication |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Air temp at race time | ~ -2°C to -4°C | Cold-to-medium temperature range; LF or HF cold spectrum |
| Snow temp | ~ -3°C to -5°C | Fine-grained transformed snow — iron-on HF or LF cold; possible blue spectrum |
| Humidity | Moderate | Watch for humidity uptick if cloud cover thickens — could shift toward wetter gliders |
| Snow age | Transformed, older base | Fluorocarbon-free HF gliders in colder range (per new FIS fluor ban rules) |
| Fluoro status | **Fluorinated waxes BANNED** (FIS ban in effect since 2023–24 season — [GearJunkie](https://gearjunkie.com/olympics/pfas-olympics-disqualifications)) | All glide waxes must be fluoro-free |

**Fluoro ban context:** The fluorinated wax ban has been strictly enforced at these Games. [Two South Korean skiers were disqualified](https://gearjunkie.com/olympics/pfas-olympics-disqualifications) in the women's sprint classic for positive fluor tests. Additionally, [controversy erupted on 10 February](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-cross-country-skiing-controversy-in-the-waxing-area-for-the-mens-classic-sprint-0213/) when a liquid and machine were spotted in the waxing area during sprint races. Wax testing will continue throughout the Games.

## Venue Snow Infrastructure

The Fabio Canal center benefits from:
- Proximity to the Avisio River for snowmaking water supply.
- A [modernized underground snowmaking system](https://www.guidetoitaly.com/val-di-fiemme-milano-cortina-2026-guide/) installed specifically for the 2026 Games.
- Historically reliable snow conditions from December through mid-March ([Bergfex — Lago di Tesero](https://www.bergfex.com/trentino/langlaufen/lago-di-tesero/)).
- Altitude of 830–985 m ([Bergfex](https://www.bergfex.com/trentino/langlaufen/lago-di-tesero/)) providing stable cold temperatures relative to lower valley locations.

## Data Gaps — To Confirm Race Morning

The following should be checked against official FIS race bulletins and service zone reports on the morning of 18 February 2026:

- [ ] Official FIS snow temperature measurement (surface and 10 cm depth)
- [ ] Official air temperature at race start
- [ ] Snow hardness / penetration rating
- [ ] Track grooming report (time of last grooming, machine used)
- [ ] Service team wax reports (Swix, Rex, Toko, Rode, Start, etc.)
- [ ] Wind at race venue (stadium is partially sheltered by terrain)
- [ ] Race jury weather bulletin
