## Team Sprint Format Explained

The team sprint is a relay-style event contested by two-athlete teams. Each team alternates skiers lap by lap. The format at the 2026 Olympics proceeds in two stages:

### Stage 1: Qualification (Interval Start)
- Teams depart at **30-second intervals** (interval start — not a mass start) ([NBC Olympics — Competition Format](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-competition-format)).
- Each skier completes **one lap** of the ~1.585 km sprint course.
- Skier A completes Lap 1, then tags Skier B for Lap 2. The team's total time for both laps is recorded.
- The **15 fastest teams** advance directly to the Final. No semi-final heats are used at the 2026 Olympics — the top 15 from qualification proceed straight to the medal race ([NBC Olympics — Diggins & Kern Preview](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/diggins-kern-carve-podium-path-klaebo-hunt-tenth-gold-team-sprint)).

- The race consists of **6 laps total** — 3 laps per skier, alternating throughout ([NBC Olympics — Competition Format](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-competition-format)).
- Structure: A1 → B1 → A2 → B2 → A3 → B3 (each letter = one lap of ~1.585 km).
- Total final race distance: approximately **9.5 km** (6 × ~1.585 km).
- Expected finish time: approximately 18 minutes for the winning team.
- The team whose **anchor skier crosses the finish line first** wins.
- Skiers exchange at a designated tag zone in the stadium finish area.

## Field Size and Bib Seeding

**26 teams** entered the Women's Team Sprint Free ([Nordic Mag — start lists](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympic-games-cross-country-skiing-start-lists-for-the-sprint-skate-team-qualifiers-0217/)), with 15 qualifying for the Final from the interval-start qualification round ([NBC Olympics — Competition Format](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/cross-country-skiing-101-competition-format)).

**Bib/start order seeding rationale:** In Olympic cross-country sprint and team sprint qualification rounds, start order is determined by the combined [FIS Sprint Points](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/cross-country/cup-standings.html) of the two team members, with lower (better) combined FIS point totals assigned earlier start positions. Nations are limited to one team entry per gender. Specific bib assignments for this race: [DATA NOT FOUND — confirm via official start list on fis-ski.com or olympics.com].
