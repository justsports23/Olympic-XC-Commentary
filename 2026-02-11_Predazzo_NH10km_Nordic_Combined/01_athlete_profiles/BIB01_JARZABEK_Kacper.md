## Key Storylines
### Poland's Return to Olympic Nordic Combined -- 70 Years After the Bronze
Poland has a proud but distant history in Olympic Nordic Combined. At the very same Cortina d'Ampezzo in 1956, Franciszek Gasienica-Gron won a stunning bronze medal -- Poland's first-ever Winter Olympic medal of any kind ([Olympics.com - Franciszek Gasienica-Gron](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/franciszek-gasienica-gron)). Now, 70 years later, Jarzabek and teammate Krzempek carry the Polish flag in Nordic Combined back to Italian soil. It is a powerful historical echo.

### Teenager at the Olympics
At just 19 years old, Jarzabek is one of the youngest athletes in the Nordic Combined field. Born in 2006, he was only 14 when he competed at his first Polish Senior Championships in 2020. His rapid progression from youth competitions to Olympic selection in just a few seasons speaks to his raw talent and Poland's investment in developing the next generation ([FIS News - Youth Cup](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2023-24/youth-cup-8-different-nations-on-the-podium)).

### The Polish NC Revival
Jarzabek is part of a seven-athlete Polish squad named for the 2025-26 season, the largest in recent memory. The squad includes both men and one woman, signaling Poland's ambition to rebuild its Nordic Combined program after years of limited international presence. His call-up alongside veterans like Andrzej Szczechowicz shows the federation is blending youth with experience ([Polish Ski Association squad announcement via stylowoztelemarkiem.pl](https://stylowoztelemarkiem.pl/sklady-kadr-polski-w-kombinacji-norweskiej-na-sezon-2025-2026/)).

- His club, TS Wisla Zakopane, is based in Poland's winter sports capital -- the same city where Gasienica-Gron trained before his 1956 Olympic bronze
