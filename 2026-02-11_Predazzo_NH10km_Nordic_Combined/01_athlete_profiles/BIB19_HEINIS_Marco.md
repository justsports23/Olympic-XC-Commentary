- **Cross-country strength:** Weak — 56th in Best Skier Trophy; this is his main area for improvement ([FIS Cup Standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/nordic-combined/cup-standings.html))
- **Best format:** Events where a big jump matters (like the normal hill Gundersen)

## Key Storylines

### Youngest Athlete in the Top 30
At just **22 years old**, Heinis is one of the youngest athletes in the World Cup's top 30. His career-best 9th at Ruka and 5th at Otepää show a rapidly ascending trajectory. He could be a future World Cup contender. ([Nordic Mag](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-ruka-johannes-lamparter-doubles-up-on-the-gundersen-marco-heinis-superb-ninth-1129/))

### France's Rising Star
While Muhlethaler (BIB 20) is France's established leader, Heinis is the future. His 12th place in the Best Jumper Trophy suggests his jumping is already world-class — if he can improve his XC skiing, he could be a medal contender at the 2030 Olympics (if NC survives).

### Jumping Prodigy, XC Work-in-Progress
The gap between his jumping rank (12th) and skiing rank (56th) tells the story: Heinis is an exceptional jumper who is still developing his cross-country. On the normal hill at Predazzo, a big jump could put him in a strong position to hold on during the 10km.
