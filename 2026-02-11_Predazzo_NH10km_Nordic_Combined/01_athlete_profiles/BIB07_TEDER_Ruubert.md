## Career Highlights
- **2026 Winter Olympics (Milano Cortina):** Selected as one of two Estonian Nordic Combined athletes alongside Kristjan Ilves -- at 16 years old, one of the youngest athletes competing at the entire 2026 Winter Olympics ([Olympics.com - Ruubert Teder](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/44211), [NBC New York - Youngest athletes at 2026 Olympics](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/youngest-athletes-2026-milan-cortina-olympics/6450058/))
- **2023 Estonian National Championships:** Won the **bronze medal** at the Estonian Nationals in Nordic Combined, finishing behind Kristjan Ilves (gold) and Markkus Alter (silver). He was noted as a "young athlete" representing the Nomme Ski Club ([FIS News - Kristjan Ilves Estonian Champion 2023](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2023-24/kristjan-ilves-is-estonian-champion-2023))
- **Continental Cup Debut (2025-26):** His first international Continental Cup appearances came in the 2025-26 season at Schonach, Germany, marking his entry into senior international competition

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Jumping:** Still developing at age 16; his jumping technique will improve significantly with more international experience and physical maturation
- **Cross-country:** At 16, his cross-country endurance is still developing but benefits from Estonia's strong endurance sports culture
- **Best format:** Individual Gundersen events at the national and Continental Cup level
- **Trajectory:** An extraordinary trajectory -- from Estonian national bronze medalist at roughly age 14 to Olympic selection at 16. He is a long-term investment for Estonian Nordic Combined
- **Comparison:** At the same age, many future Nordic Combined champions were still competing in junior events. Teder's Olympic debut at 16 is unusually early for the discipline

## Key Storylines
### The Youngest in the Field -- A 16-Year-Old Olympian
Ruubert Teder, born in 2009, is just **16 years old** -- making him one of the youngest athletes at the entire 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics. In Nordic Combined, a discipline that rewards the maturity and endurance typically found in athletes in their mid-to-late 20s, a teenager competing at the Games is exceptional. NBC highlighted him among the youngest competitors heading to Milan-Cortina ([NBC New York](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/olympics/2026-milan-cortina/youngest-athletes-2026-milan-cortina-olympics/6450058/)). To put his age in context: he was 12 years old when the last Winter Olympics were held in Beijing. He was born the year after the Vancouver 2010 Games.

### Learning from the Best: Kristjan Ilves
Teder has the extraordinary advantage of training alongside **Kristjan Ilves** (BIB 26), Estonia's top Nordic Combined athlete and a consistent top-20 World Cup performer. Ilves, who won the Estonian national title ahead of Teder in 2023, serves as both a teammate and a mentor. Having a world-class athlete in the same small national program gives Teder a training partner and role model that most athletes from small nations never have. Their coach at these Olympics is Jan Andreas Schmid ([Estonian Olympic Committee](https://www.eok.ee/organization/news/estonian-olympic-committee-confirms-national-team-for-milano-cortina-2026-winter-olympic-games)).

### Estonia Punching Above Its Weight
Estonia, a nation of just 1.3 million people, has no business being competitive in Nordic Combined -- yet it is. Kristjan Ilves has established Estonia as a genuine force in the discipline, and Teder represents the next generation. The fact that Estonia can send two athletes to the Olympics (the maximum for most smaller nations) speaks to the quality of its development pipeline. The Nomme Ski Club, based in the Nomme district of Tallinn, has been central to this success ([FIS News - Estonian Champions 2023](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2023-24/kristjan-ilves-is-estonian-champion-2023)).

### The Teder Family in Nordic Sports
Interestingly, the FIS database also lists a **Villu Teder** with an Estonian Nordic Combined biography, suggesting a possible family connection to the sport. While this has not been confirmed, it would fit a pattern seen across Nordic sports where family traditions in skiing run deep ([FIS Athlete Biography - Villu Teder](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sector=NK&competitorid=60922&type=st-WCB)).

### Olympic Experience for the Future
Teder is not expected to challenge for a medal at these Games -- but that is not the point. This Olympic experience at age 16 is an investment in his future. If he continues to develop, he could compete at the 2030 Winter Olympics in the French Alps at age 21, the 2034 Games in Salt Lake City at age 25 (prime NC age), and potentially beyond. He could have a four-or-five Olympic career ahead of him.

## Personal Life
- **Education:** Still attending basic school (põhikool) in Tallinn — one of the youngest Olympians at these Games ([Estonian Olympic Committee](https://www.eok.ee/organization/news/estonian-olympic-committee-confirms-national-team-for-milano-cortina-2026-winter-olympic-games))
- **Nickname:** Known as the Estonian team's "pesamuna" (nest egg/youngest talent) — a term of endearment for the baby of the team
- **Record:** At age 15, became Estonia's youngest athlete ever to fulfill the World Cup qualification norm. His quote about the qualifying race: "It was cold and snow was flying from trees into my face, but I gave it my all and got it done!"

- He won the Estonian national bronze medal at approximately age 14, competing against adults including Kristjan Ilves
- The Nomme Ski Club, his home club, is based in the leafy Nomme district of Tallinn -- not exactly a mountainous area, but Estonia's dedication to winter sports makes it work
- Estonia hosted a FIS Nordic Combined World Cup event at Otepaa in the 2024-25 season, showing the country's commitment to the sport at the highest level ([FIS Event - Otepaa 2025](https://www.olympics.com/en/sport-events/2025-fis-nordic-combined-viessmann-world-cup-otepaa))
- He could theoretically compete at five or more Winter Olympics if his career goes the distance -- a remarkable prospect for any athlete
