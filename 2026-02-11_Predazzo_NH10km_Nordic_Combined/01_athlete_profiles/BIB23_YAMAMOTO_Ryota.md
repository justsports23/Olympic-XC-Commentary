## Career Highlights
- **Olympic Games (Beijing 2022):**
  - Individual Normal Hill/10km: **Led after ski jumping** with a magnificent 108m jump (133 pts, 1st after jump, 38-second lead), but faded in the cross-country race to finish **14th** ([Eurosport - Beijing 2022](https://www.eurosport.com/nordic-combined/beijing-2022/2022/winter-olympics-2022-japan-s-ryota-yamamoto-tops-nordic-combined-leaderboard-after-ski-jumping_sto8771386/story.shtml))
  - Team Large Hill/4x5km: **Bronze medal** as anchor leg of the all-Waseda University team (Akito Watabe, Yoshito Watabe, Hideaki Nagai, Ryota Yamamoto) — Japan's first Nordic Combined relay Olympic medal since gold medals in 1992 and 1994 ([Waseda University Athletic Center](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/athletic/news-en/2022/03/04/25439/?lng=en); [Japan Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2022/02/17/olympics/winter-olympics/olympics-nordic-combined/japan-nordic-team-bronze/))
- **World Cup podiums:** 2 individual podiums (both 3rd at Lahti 2021) + 1 team sprint podium ([FIS Athlete of the Week](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/athlete-of-the-week-ryota-yamamoto-jpn))
- **World Cup debut:** 2017 in Sapporo (home ground), became World Cup regular from 2019-20 season ([FIS Athlete of the Week](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/athlete-of-the-week-ryota-yamamoto-jpn))
- **FIS World Championships:**
  - Oberstdorf 2021: **4th** in both events — agonizingly close to a medal at his first Worlds ([FIS Oberstdorf Preview](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2020-21/medals-looking-for-owners-oberstdorf-2021-is-here))
  - Planica 2023: **2nd in HS138 ski jumping** phase with a 140m leap (143.7 pts), 36 seconds behind Riiber going into the XC ([FIS WSC Planica](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2022-23/wsc-riiber-leads-with-hill-record-after-ski-jumping))
- **Junior World Championships:** Debuted at Val di Fiemme 2014 (the same venue as today's Olympic race), finishing 39th in Normal Hill/5km ([OnTrend - Yamamoto Bio](https://ontrend.news/ryota-yamamoto-wikipedia-biography-net-worth-instagram))
- **Personal best jump:** 164 meters at Vikersundbakken, March 16, 2023 ([weltski.de - Yamamoto](https://www.weltski.de/en/person/sp47/nordic-combined/pe484803/ryota-yamamoto/))

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Ski jumping:** World class. Best Jumper Trophy ranking of 11th (560 pts) puts him among the best jumpers in Nordic Combined globally. At Beijing 2022, his 108m was the longest jump in the Individual NH event. At Ramsau Dec 2024, he won the compact jumping competition outright. At Planica 2023 Worlds, his 140m was second only to Riiber
- **Cross-country weakness:** His Achilles heel. Best Skier Trophy ranking of 37th (113 pts) vs. 11th in jumping illustrates the gap. At Beijing 2022, he led by 38 seconds after jumping and was caught and passed, finishing 14th. This pattern — dominating the jump, fading on the track — is the defining narrative of his career
- **Best format:** Any event with a large hill or where jumping advantage is magnified. Compact events where XC distance is shorter also suit him
- **Climbing ability:** Below elite level — the XC phase consistently erodes his jumping advantage
- **Distance preference:** Shorter XC distances favor him; the 10km format today is the standard he has to manage

## Key Storylines

### The Flying Heartbreak — Beijing 2022 Revisited
Yamamoto's individual race at Beijing 2022 is one of Nordic Combined's great "what if" stories. He soared to a 108-meter jump, took a 38-second lead into the cross-country phase, and for a fleeting moment, Japan dreamed of individual gold. But the XC course was unforgiving — he established himself at the front after the first loop, then struggled in the second half, eventually slipping from the lead pack to finish 14th ([Eurosport - Beijing 2022](https://www.eurosport.com/nordic-combined/beijing-2022/2022/winter-olympics-2022-japan-s-ryota-yamamoto-tops-nordic-combined-leaderboard-after-ski-jumping_sto8771386/story.shtml)). Today is his chance at redemption.

### Olympic Bronze and the All-Waseda Team
The redemption at Beijing came in the team event. All four members of the Japanese relay squad — Akito Watabe, Yoshito Watabe, Hideaki Nagai, and Ryota Yamamoto — were Waseda University alumni. Their bronze medal was Japan's first Nordic Combined relay podium at the Olympics since the legendary back-to-back golds at Albertville 1992 and Lillehammer 1994. Yamamoto anchored the final leg, holding on to third after Akito Watabe's blistering third leg gave him a buffer ([Waseda University Athletic Center](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/athletic/news-en/2022/03/04/25439/?lng=en); [Japan Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2022/02/17/olympics/winter-olympics/olympics-nordic-combined/japan-nordic-team-bronze/))

### Family Tradition — The Yamamoto Dynasty
Nordic Combined runs in the Yamamoto blood. Father **Naotoshi Yamamoto** was himself a Nordic Combined athlete who competed for the Kitano Construction team alongside the legendary Kenji Ogiwara, winning 2 All-Japan Championships before retiring in 1996. He "tricked" young Ryota into starting the sport by taking him to ski slopes on weekends — Ryota began jumping in 3rd grade. Naotoshi became his sons' first coach ([OnTrend - Yamamoto Bio](https://ontrend.news/ryota-yamamoto-wikipedia-biography-net-worth-instagram)).

**Tragedy struck in 2017** when Naotoshi passed away during Ryota's second year at Waseda University. Ryota was devastated and was bedridden for a period. His remarkable comeback from that grief — to become an Olympic bronze medalist and fulfill his father's Olympic dream — is one of Nordic Combined's most powerful personal stories ([OnTrend - Yamamoto Bio](https://ontrend.news/ryota-yamamoto-wikipedia-biography-net-worth-instagram)).

Ryota's younger brother **Yuya Yamamoto** also competes in Nordic Combined internationally, and the two raced together on Japan's team at the 2023 World Championships in Planica ([Teller Report - Planica 2023](https://www.tellerreport.com/sports/2023-03-01-nordic-ski-world-championships-combined-men-s-team-japan-ranked-7th.BJZxRBWpCs.html); [FIS Bio - Yuya Yamamoto](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=nk&competitorid=220081&type=result))

### Waseda University Connection
Yamamoto attended Waseda University in Tokyo, one of Japan's most prestigious universities and the same institution attended by legendary teammate Akito Watabe. The Waseda ski program has become a pipeline for Japanese Nordic Combined talent ([Waseda University Athletic Center](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/athletic/news-en/2022/03/04/25439/?lng=en))

### Back to Val di Fiemme — Full Circle
There is poetic symmetry here: Yamamoto's very first Junior World Championships were held at Val di Fiemme in 2014, where he finished 39th as a raw teenager. Twelve years later, he returns to the same Italian valley as an Olympic bronze medalist and two-time World Cup podium finisher, competing at the Olympic Games. He also won the provisional jumping round at the Val di Fiemme Grand Prix event in September 2025, so he knows this hill well.
