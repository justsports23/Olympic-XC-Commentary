## Key Storylines

### Brother Act — Oftebro vs. Oftebro
Jens (BIB 35) and Einar (BIB 33) are one of TWO sibling pairs in the field. The Oftebro brothers from Bærum have been a fixture of Norwegian Nordic Combined. Jens is the younger but more accomplished brother — an Olympic gold and silver medalist. They compete together but also against each other, adding an emotional dynamic.

### Post-Riiber Era Leadership
With the retirement of legendary teammate Jarl Magnus Riiber (who dominated the 2018-19 through 2024-25 era), Jens has stepped up as Norway's team leader. He is now the #1 Norwegian in the World Cup standings.

### Best Skier in the World
Jens leads the Best Skier Trophy with 1,213 points — meaning he is the single fastest cross-country skier in Nordic Combined this season. If he can produce a decent jump, he has the XC legs to run down anyone.

### Beijing Memories
At Beijing 2022, Jens won gold in the team event and came agonizingly close in the individual large hill, taking silver. He'll be looking to upgrade that to individual gold.
