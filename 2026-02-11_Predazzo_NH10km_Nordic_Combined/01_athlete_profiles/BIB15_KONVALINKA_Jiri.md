## Career Highlights
- **Olympic Games:** First Olympic selection at Milano Cortina 2026 — at just 21 years old, the youngest athlete in this field ([Olympics.com - Jiri Konvalinka](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/jiri-konvalinka))
- **World Cup career best:** 18th at Val di Fiemme (the Olympic venue!) with 7th-best jump of the day ([FIS Val di Fiemme Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=NK&raceid=3472))
- **FIS World Ski Championships:** Competed in the Nordic Combined Men's Team Large Hill HS138/4x5km at Planica 2023 for Czech Republic ([Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/jiri-konvalinka-of-team-czech-republic-competes-during-the-news-photo/1470461793))
- **Youth Olympic Winter Games:** 11th place in Normal Hill HS90, Lausanne 2020 ([FIS Ski Jumping Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?competitorid=204031&sectorcode=jp&type=result))
- **FIS Youth Cup domination:** Won multiple Youth Cup events in Harrachov (2020-21) alongside Jan Simek; won jumping in Youth category at OPA Games ([FIS Youth Cup Harrachov](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/successful-fis-youth-cup-weekend-in-harrachov-cze); [FIS OPA Games](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2018-19/nordic-combined-ladies-and-men-in-action-at-opa-games))
- **FIS Youth Cup 2018-19 Trondheim:** 2nd place Saturday, 3rd place Sunday in Youth category ([FIS Youth Cup Trondheim](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2018-19/fis-youth-cup-2018-19-wraps-up-in-trondheim))
- **Junior World Championships:** Selected for CZE Junior Worlds team 2020-21 ([FIS JWC Nominations](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/junior-world-championship-starters-named))
- **Ski Jumping background:** Also registered as a FIS ski jumper (competitor ID 204031), reflecting his dual-sport capacity ([FIS SJ Bio](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?competitorid=204031&sectorcode=jp&type=result))

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Ski jumping:** Elite. His Best Jumper Trophy ranking of 20th (345 pts) far outstrips his overall standing. He regularly finishes in the top 15 after the jumping leg — at Val di Fiemme he was **7th after jumping** with 125.5m ([FIS Val di Fiemme Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=NK&raceid=3472))
- **Cross-country weakness:** His Best Skier ranking of 59th (just 9 pts) reveals the gap. He consistently loses positions on the XC course — e.g., at Ruka going from 12th after jump to 24th; at Trondheim from 14th to 32nd
- **Best format:** Compact events or courses that minimize XC distance, or any event where jumping advantage is maximized
- **Climbing ability:** Below average at elite level — the cross-country phase is where he hemorrhages time

## Key Storylines

### The 21-Year-Old Olympic Debutant
At just 21 years old, Konvalinka is one of the youngest competitors in the Olympic Nordic Combined field. Born in November 2004, he was only 13 when he first appeared at FIS Youth Cup events. His progression from Youth Cup champion to Olympic athlete in less than eight years reflects both prodigious jumping talent and rapid development ([Olympics.com - Jiri Konvalinka](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/jiri-konvalinka); [FIS Youth Cup Harrachov](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/successful-fis-youth-cup-weekend-in-harrachov-cze))

### Flying Czech — The Jumping Specialist
Konvalinka's calling card is his ski jumping. With a Best Jumper Trophy ranking of 20th — the highest of any athlete outside the top-25 overall — he is arguably the most lopsided "jump specialist" in this field. At Val di Fiemme, on this very Olympic course, he had the 7th-best jump of the day with 125.5m, starting the XC in a strong position before the cross-country eroded his advantage ([FIS Val di Fiemme Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=NK&raceid=3472); [FIS Cup Standings](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/nordic-combined/cup-standings.html))

### Czech Republic's Nordic Combined Future
Konvalinka, alongside veteran Jan Vytrval (BIB 18), represents the Czech Republic's investment in Nordic Combined. While the Czech program has produced solid competitors like Tomas Portyk and Lukas Danek, Konvalinka represents the next generation. His youth and raw jumping talent suggest an athlete whose best years are still ahead of him.

### Val di Fiemme 18th — The Olympic Course Preview
Perhaps the most important data point for today: Konvalinka finished 18th at Val di Fiemme earlier this season in a World Cup event on essentially the same course. He was 7th after jumping with a 125.5m leap and held on well enough in the XC to finish 18th — his career-best World Cup result. That performance on the Olympic course is a very positive sign ([FIS Val di Fiemme Results](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=NK&raceid=3472))

- Harrachov, his home and club, is one of the most famous ski jumping venues in the Czech Republic — home to a Ski Flying hill (HS205) and deep ski jumping tradition

- At the OPA Games, young Konvalinka won the children's jumping with a 71.5m effort, took a 19-second lead into the XC — then got caught by Austria's Severin Reiter on the track, a perfect early example of the pattern that defines his career: jump brilliantly, then fight to hold on ([FIS OPA Games](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2018-19/nordic-combined-ladies-and-men-in-action-at-opa-games))
