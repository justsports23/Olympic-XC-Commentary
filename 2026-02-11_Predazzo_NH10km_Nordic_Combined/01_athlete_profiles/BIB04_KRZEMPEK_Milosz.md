## Career Highlights
- **2026 Winter Olympics (Milano Cortina):** Selected as one of two Polish Nordic Combined athletes alongside Kacper Jarzabek. Completed training jumps at Predazzo with distances of 95.5m, 92.0m, and 93.5m ([sportowefakty.wp.pl](https://sportowefakty.wp.pl/igrzyska-olimpijskie/1233696/mediolan-cortina-2026-polacy-przetestowali-skocznie-w-predazzo))
- **Two-time Polish Senior Vice-Champion:** Silver medalist at the Polish Senior Summer Championships in Nordic Combined in Zakopane on two occasions, representing WSS Wisla ([sport.olza.pl](https://sport.olza.pl/en/aktualnosc/milosz-krzempek-wicemistrzem-polski), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/milosz_kenzi_krzempek/))
- **Polish National Championships (2020-21):** Third after the jumping portion at the Polish Senior Championships in Szczyrk (HS 105), jumping 92.5m for 106 points, behind Kupczak and Jarzabek ([FIS News - Kupczak dominates Polish Nationals](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2020-21/szczepan-kupczak-dominates-at-polish-national-championships))
- **Ski Jumping Background:** Also competes in standalone ski jumping at FIS level, with results dating back to 2018 in Szczyrk -- this dual-discipline background gives him strong technical jumping foundations ([FIS SJ Biography](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=jp&competitorid=229769&type=result))

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Jumping strength:** Arguably his strongest discipline -- the 126.5m jump at Val di Fiemme (16th in jumping!) shows elite-level hill capability. His dual ski jumping/Nordic Combined background gives him technical expertise on the hill ([FIS NC Results - Val di Fiemme](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=NK&raceid=3472))
- **Cross-country:** His weaker discipline; cross-country time-backs of 3:49 to 5:20 show significant room for improvement. The gap between his strong jumping and weaker skiing is the classic profile of a jumper-turned-combined athlete
- **Best format:** Individual Gundersen events where a strong jump can provide a buffer
- **Key weakness:** Cross-country pacing and fitness; if he can close the gap on the skiing side, his jumping talent could yield breakthrough results

## Key Storylines
### The Jumping Specialist
Krzempek's profile is that of a ski jumper who branched into Nordic Combined -- a common pathway in the sport. His 126.5m jump at Val di Fiemme placed him 16th in the jumping portion, among the best hill results of anyone in the lower-seeded group. But his cross-country times tell a different story: he lost 3:49 in the skiing at Val di Fiemme, dropping from 16th to 52nd. The challenge for Krzempek is bridging this gap, and the Olympic 10km cross-country course at Predazzo will be a test of whether his skiing has improved enough to complement his jumping talent.

### Istebna to the Olympics
Krzempek hails from Istebna, a small village in the Silesian Beskids mountains near the Czech border -- a traditional heartland of Polish skiing. The region, including nearby Wisla (where his club WSS Wisla is based), has produced generations of ski jumpers and Nordic Combined athletes. Representing this storied winter sports community on the Olympic stage carries deep local significance ([sport.olza.pl](https://sport.olza.pl/en/aktualnosc/milosz-krzempek-wicemistrzem-polski)).

### Poland's Cortina Connection
Like teammate Jarzabek, Krzempek carries the weight of Polish Nordic Combined history. Franciszek Gasienica-Gron's 1956 bronze medal at Cortina d'Ampezzo remains Poland's only Olympic medal in the discipline. Seventy years later, Krzempek and Jarzabek return to Italian soil seeking to write a new chapter ([Olympics.com - Gasienica-Gron](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/franciszek-gasienica-gron)).

## Fun Facts for Fans
- At 22, Krzempek is three years older than his teammate Jarzabek -- together they represent a youthful Polish duo with room to grow

- Istebna, his hometown, is known for its folk culture and traditional wooden architecture as much as its skiing -- a picturesque mountain village that has produced an Olympic athlete
- His Instagram handle (@milosz_kenzi_krzempek) gives a personal window into the life of a young Polish winter sports athlete balancing training with everyday life
- His training jumps at the Predazzo Olympic hill (95.5m, 92.0m, 93.5m) give a preview of what to expect in competition
