## Key Storylines

### France's Nordic Combined Leader
Muhlethaler is consistently described as the "leader" of the French Nordic Combined team. He finished the 2024-25 season on a high (podium at Lahti, 5th in Oslo) and came agonizingly close to retaining the Summer GP title. He enters the Olympics as France's strongest medal hopeful in NC.

### French NC Tradition — Lamy-Chappuis Legacy
France's last Olympic Nordic Combined gold was Jason Lamy-Chappuis at Vancouver 2010. Muhlethaler represents the next generation of French NC, carrying the legacy of Lamy-Chappuis and the country's strong tradition in the sport.

### Summer GP Dominance
Winning the 2024 Summer GP overall and finishing 2nd in 2025 (just 6 points behind Rydzek) shows Muhlethaler has the talent to compete with the very best. Translating summer form into winter Olympic results is the challenge.
