## Key Storylines

### Best Jumper in the Field?
Thomas Rettenegger has been described as this season's best jumper on the World Cup circuit. On the normal hill at Predazzo, a big jump could give him a time gap that even the best skiers can't close in 10km. This makes him a dark horse for the podium.

### Brother Dynamics
Thomas followed his younger brother Stefan into the World Cup spotlight. They share the same sponsors (Felbermayr), train together, and now both compete at the Olympics. Thomas won at Ramsau (Austria) on home soil — a moment of pride for the family. ([Felbermayr](https://www.felbermayr.cc/en/news/detail/brand-ambassadors-thomas-and-stefan-rettenegger))

### Austria's Depth
Austria brings three legitimate medal contenders: Lamparter (WC leader), Stefan Rettenegger (5th WC), and Thomas. This depth is remarkable for a three-athlete team.
