## Career Highlights
- **Olympic Games:** First-ever Olympic selection at Milano Cortina 2026 ([Nordic Mag - Olympic Selection](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-at-the-start-of-the-season-i-didnt-even-think-i-had-a-chance-of-going-mael-tyrodes-joy-after-his-selection-for-the-2026-olympics-0130/))
- **World Cup career best:** 18th place at Ramsau, December 2025 ([Nordic Mag - Ramsau](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-ramsau-the-gundersen-for-the-returning-vinzenz-geiger-laurent-muhlethaler-and-mael-tyrode-in-the-top-20-1220/))
- **16 World Cup starts** entering the 2025-26 season, with previous best of 31st place at World Cup level ([Nordic Mag - Olympic Selection](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-at-the-start-of-the-season-i-didnt-even-think-i-had-a-chance-of-going-mael-tyrodes-joy-after-his-selection-for-the-2026-olympics-0130/))
- **Continental Cup:** Multiple top-10 finishes across 2024-25 season, 6th at Ruka as season highlight
- **Summer Grand Prix:** 3rd place in team sprint with Edgar Vallet at Chaux-Neuve, on home soil ([Nordic Mag - Chaux-Neuve Summer GP](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-edgar-vallet-and-mael-tyrode-on-home-soil-finish-third-in-the-team-sprint-at-the-summer-grand-prix-in-chaux-neuve-0831/))

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Cross-country strength:** Tyrode's strongest suit. At Ruka COC, he started 19th (1:21 behind the leader) and climbed to 6th, finishing just 7 seconds off the podium, showcasing exceptional XC closing speed ([Nordic Mag - Ruka COC](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-mael-tyrodes-big-comeback-a-stunning-6th-place-in-the-ruka-continental-cup-1213/))
- **Ski jumping:** Developing. Best Jumper ranking of 41st suggests this is the weaker half, but results at Seefeld (126.6m, 21st in jumping) show improvement
- **Best format:** Gundersen — his ability to chase down athletes in front of him on the XC course suits this format perfectly
- **Climbing ability:** Strong — the Jura Mountains background and XC prowess suggest good uphill capacity

## Key Storylines

### The Late Bloomer Who Shocked Himself
Tyrode's Olympic journey is a story of persistence and late-season breakthroughs. He began the 2025-26 season in Group B, then moved up to Group A as the sixth man on the French squad. In his own words: "At the start of the season, I didn't even think I had a chance of going" to the Olympics ([Nordic Mag - Olympic Selection](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-at-the-start-of-the-season-i-didnt-even-think-i-had-a-chance-of-going-mael-tyrodes-joy-after-his-selection-for-the-2026-olympics-0130/)). He benefited from a reallocated quota place to earn his Olympic berth — making his debut at the Games at age 25.

### Carrying the Tricolore Tradition
France has a proud Nordic Combined Olympic pedigree. Fabrice Guy and Sylvain Guillaume medaled at Albertville 1992, the 1998 team took a medal at Nagano, and Jason Lamy Chappuis famously won individual gold at Vancouver 2010 ([Nordic Mag - French Olympic Ambitions](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-pierre-mignerey-ffs-national-technical-director-outlines-the-french-teams-ambitions-for-the-2026-olympics-try-to-raise-our-level-in-these-olympic-events-0131/)). However, it has been sixteen years since France last stood on the Olympic podium in this discipline. Tyrode, alongside Marco Heinis and Laurent Muhlethaler, carries that legacy forward.

### Franche-Comte's Finest
All three French Olympic Nordic Combined athletes — Tyrode (S.C. Les Fourgs), Muhlethaler (Premanon SC), and Heinis (Olympic Mont d'Or) — hail from the Massif Jurassien region of Franche-Comte in eastern France, the heartland of French Nordic skiing ([Nordic Mag - Olympic Selection](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-at-the-start-of-the-season-i-didnt-even-think-i-had-a-chance-of-going-mael-tyrodes-joy-after-his-selection-for-the-2026-olympics-0130/); [BFC Sports Profile](https://sports.bourgognefranchecomte.fr/index.php/mael-tyrode-la-force-tranquille/))

### The Cross-Country Closer
Tyrode's XC ability is his calling card. His Continental Cup 6th at Ruka demonstrated his ability to dramatically move through the field — starting 19th, 1:21 behind the leaders, and picking off rivals all the way to 6th, missing the podium by just 7 seconds ([Nordic Mag - Ruka COC](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/nordic-combined-mael-tyrodes-big-comeback-a-stunning-6th-place-in-the-ruka-continental-cup-1213/)). If he can put together a reasonable jump today, watch for him on the XC course.
