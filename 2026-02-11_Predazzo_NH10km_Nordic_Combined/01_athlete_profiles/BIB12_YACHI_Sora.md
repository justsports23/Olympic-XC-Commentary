## Key Storylines

### Japan's Proud Nordic Combined Tradition
Yachi represents the next generation of Japanese Nordic Combined. Japan has a rich history in the sport — Kenji Ogiwara dominated the 1990s, and Akito Watabe (BIB 21, competing alongside Yachi) has won 4 Olympic medals. If Nordic Combined is dropped after 2026, Yachi's generation will be the last Japanese Olympic NC athletes. ([JAL — Sora Yachi](https://www.jal.com/en/sports/athlete-employee/yachi/))
