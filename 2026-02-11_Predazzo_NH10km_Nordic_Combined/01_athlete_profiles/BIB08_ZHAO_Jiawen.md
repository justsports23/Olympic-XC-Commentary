## Key Storylines

### The Torchbearer
At the Beijing 2022 Opening Ceremony, Zhao Jiawen was chosen as one of the final two torchbearers to **light the Olympic cauldron**. He lit the flame that opened China's historic home Olympics — an honor reserved for the most symbolically important athletes. At the time, he hadn't yet competed in his Nordic Combined event. ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20220211/5dcbda6475e948679209578bc1387af9/c.html))

### First Chinese Nordic Combined Olympian
Zhao is literally the pioneer of Nordic Combined in China. When China began forming its Nordic Combined national team in late 2016 for Beijing 2022, they started with 20 athletes. The team was whittled down to just 5, with Zhao earning China's first-ever Olympic quota spot. ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20220209/b730e382fe134a728710545e527d740f/c.html))

### From Cross-Country to Jumping
Zhao was originally a cross-country skier from Shanxi province. He had to overcome his fear of ski jumping to transition to Nordic Combined — a challenge that speaks to his courage and determination. ([China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202402/02/WS65bc43dfa3104efcbdae9403.html))

### Dramatic Improvement
His Beijing 2022 jump was 81 meters. By the 2024 National Winter Games, he was jumping 102.5 meters — a massive improvement. His goal for 2026: "To stand on the podium." ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240131/51caa92c39644249b32d78f84276c348/c.html))

### 43rd is a Triumph
His 43rd-place finish at Beijing 2022 may look modest on paper, but it was a groundbreaking moment for Chinese winter sports. The fact that he completed the competition at all — as the first Chinese Nordic Combined Olympian — was celebrated nationally.

- **Mother:** Yuan Hongxia — initially uncertain about her son pursuing athletics, believing he should focus on studies. But when he called from Japan wanting to quit, she told him: "No, son. Once you've made a choice, you can't give up halfway" ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240131/51caa92c39644249b32d78f84276c348/c.html))

- **Career path:** Cross-country skiing from 2015, transitioned to Nordic Combined in 2016 when China formed its NC program. Had to overcome genuine fear of ski jumping — called his mother from a training camp in Hokkaido wanting to quit after seeing the 100-meter jump for the first time ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240131/51caa92c39644249b32d78f84276c348/c.html))
