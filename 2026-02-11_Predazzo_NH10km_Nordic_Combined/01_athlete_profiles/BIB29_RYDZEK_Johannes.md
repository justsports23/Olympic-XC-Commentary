He has seen the sport through multiple generations. ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/johannes-rydzek))

### 2017 Legend
Rydzek's 2017 World Championships in Lahti was one of the greatest individual performances in Nordic Combined history — he won EVERY possible gold medal. No athlete had ever achieved this before. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Rydzek))

### The Oberstdorf Three
Remarkably, all three German athletes (Geiger, Schmid, and Rydzek) hail from Oberstdorf, the famous Bavarian ski town. They grew up together, trained together, and now compete for Olympic glory together.

### Coaching Future
Rydzek has expressed interest in transitioning to coaching or mentorship after his competitive career, wanting to pass his knowledge to the next generation.

### Father of German Success
Germany's Nordic Combined dominance (5 of 9 medals at PyeongChang 2018, including all 3 golds) was built on Rydzek's leadership. He won 2 golds at PyeongChang. ([Olympics.com](https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/johannes-rydzek))
