### Possible Family Connection to Ema Klinec
Slovenian ski jumping World Champion Ema Klinec (née Brecl) has stated she was inspired to take up ski jumping by her "older brother Gašper." This may refer to Gašper Brecl — if confirmed, it would mean his sister is a **World Champion ski jumper**. Jerneja Brecl, another athlete with the Brecl surname, also competed in ski jumping at the 2021 World Championships.

## Key Storylines

### First Olympics
Milano Cortina 2026 is Brecl's first Olympic Games — a significant milestone for any athlete. Slovenia's small Nordic Combined program sends two athletes (Brecl and Vrhovnik), demonstrating the nation's commitment to the sport.

### Slovenian Ski Jumping Heritage
Slovenia has produced legendary ski jumpers (Peter Prevc, Ema Klinec, Nika Prevc). The NC program benefits from this jumping expertise, with coach Goran Janus having crossed over from the ski jumping program.
