## Key Storylines

### The Comeback Kid
Costa stunned the Italian winter sports world about a year ago when he surprisingly announced his retirement. He was Italy's best Nordic Combined athlete at the time. But the pull of a home Olympics proved too strong — he reversed his decision and returned to the squad for the 2025-26 season. "Withdrawal from retirement!" headlined SportNews.bz. ([SportNews.bz](https://en.sportnews.bz/artikel/wintersport/nordische-kombination/ruecktritt-vom-ruecktritt-samuel-costa-ist-wieder-da))

### Home Course Debut
Costa made his World Cup debut at **Val di Fiemme in 2012** — the same venue where he now competes at the Olympics. He has deep, personal connections to this course and area.

### The Passion Quote
In an FIS interview, Costa said: "The passion for the sport is still the same." He has spoken about how the sport has become far more professional, requiring athletes to do many things right to be successful.

### Digital Detox
Costa has deliberately stepped away from social media, describing it as a relief. "It takes too much time and energy to create content," he said. He prefers to use his limited energy elsewhere — a refreshingly honest stance for a modern athlete.

### Mountain Man
In his free time, Costa is an avid hiker and climber in the mountains — a passion he shares with close friend and fellow athlete Johannes Rydzek (GER, BIB 29). The cross-national friendship adds warmth to the competitive dynamic. ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/samuel-costa-the-passion-for-the-sport-is-still-the-same-))

### Born in Bolzano
Costa was born in Bolzano (Bozen), in the bilingual German-Italian part of South Tyrol. He's from the Val Gardena area — the heart of Italian mountain culture. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Costa_(skier)))

## Personal Life
- **Wife:** Amanda — during his sabbatical year (2024-25), Costa traveled with Amanda for self-discovery, stepping away from competitive skiing entirely
- **Personality:** Felt the sport had consumed his identity. Returned to competition with a renewed mindset, saying the break helped him rediscover who he was beyond Nordic Combined
- **Languages:** Likely speaks Italian, German, and possibly Ladin — given his South Tyrolean background in the bilingual region
- **Friends:** Close bond with Johannes Rydzek (GER, BIB 29) — they share a love of hiking and climbing in the mountains ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/samuel-costa-the-passion-for-the-sport-is-still-the-same-))
- **Digital detox:** Deliberately quit social media, describing it as a relief: "It takes too much time and energy to create content" ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/samuel-costa-the-passion-for-the-sport-is-still-the-same-))
