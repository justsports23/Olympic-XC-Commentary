## Technique & Format Profile
- **Balanced approach:** Unlike his younger teammate Konvalinka, Vytrval's Best Jumper (28th) and Best Skier (31st) rankings are relatively close, making him a more rounded athlete
- **Ski jumping:** Solid, not spectacular. His Otepaa compact showing — briefly leading the jumping leaderboard with a 94.5m jump — demonstrates he can have standout moments on the hill ([FIS Lamparter Dominates Otepaa](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/lamparter-dominates-otepaeae-compact-to-extend-overall-lead))
- **Cross-country:** Competitive in the middle pack. His Best Skier ranking of 31st is respectable and far superior to teammate Konvalinka's
- **Best format:** Gundersen — his balanced skillset suits the traditional format well
- **Climbing ability:** Adequate for the mid-field; less likely to dramatically gain or lose positions on climbs

## Key Storylines

### The Experienced Czech Leader
At 27, Vytrval is the veteran of the Czech Nordic Combined duo. This is his second Olympics — he competed at Beijing 2022, where he finished 27th individually and contributed to the Czech team's 7th-place finish in the team relay. That Olympic experience is invaluable in navigating the unique pressures of the Games ([Wikipedia - Czech Republic at Beijing 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics); [Olympics.com - Jan Vytrval](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/results/athlete-details/43167))

### Beijing 2022 — Strong Jumper, Team Player
At the Beijing Olympics, Vytrval showed he can deliver on the big stage: his Individual Large Hill jump score of 128.0 points was 16th-best in the field, and in the team event, the Czech quartet of Pazout, Vytrval, Danek, and Portyk finished a creditable 7th, just 2:25 behind Norway's gold-medal winning team ([Wikipedia - Czech Republic at Beijing 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics))

### The Resilient Campaigner
Vytrval's longevity in the sport is notable. He debuted at the Continental Cup level in December 2015 at just 17 years old in Soldier Hollow, USA, and made his World Cup debut in Lillehammer in December 2016. He spent years battling between Continental Cup and World Cup level, gradually establishing himself as a regular World Cup competitor. His career trajectory shows persistent improvement season over season ([de.wikipedia.org - Jan Vytrval](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Vytrval); [FIS Czech Teams Article](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2018-19/articleczech-teams-and-coaching-changes-announced))

### Jilemnice to the Olympics
Born in Jilemnice, a town in the Krkonose (Giant Mountains) region with deep Nordic skiing roots, and now residing in Harrachov — one of the Czech Republic's most iconic winter sports venues — Vytrval represents the heartland of Czech ski sport. Jilemnice is home to one of the oldest ski museums in the world, reflecting the region's centuries-old skiing heritage.
