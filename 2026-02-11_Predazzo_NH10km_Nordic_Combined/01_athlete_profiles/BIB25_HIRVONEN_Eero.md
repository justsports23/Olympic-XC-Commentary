## Key Storylines

### PyeongChang 2018 — So Close
Hirvonen finished **6th** at PyeongChang 2018 in the individual NH/10km — the best Finnish result. He was the closest challenger outside the lead group, finishing 52 seconds behind Eric Frenzel's gold. He has spent the years since chasing that elusive podium.

### Finnish Depth
Finland fields three strong NC athletes: Herola (BIB 30), Hirvonen (BIB 25), and Karhumaa (BIB 10). Herola and Hirvonen are both experienced Olympians who can push each other during the race.

### The Outdoorsman
In his free time, Hirvonen is an avid hunter and fisherman — classic Finnish outdoor pursuits that keep him connected to nature between competitions.
