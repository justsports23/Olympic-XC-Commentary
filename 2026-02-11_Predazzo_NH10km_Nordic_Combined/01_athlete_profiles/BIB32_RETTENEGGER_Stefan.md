## Key Storylines

### The Rettenegger Brothers
Stefan and Thomas (BIB 31) are brothers from Pongau in Salzburger Land, Austria. They are the SECOND set of brothers in this field (alongside the Oftebros from Norway). The "battle of the brothers" angle — two pairs of siblings from two different nations all competing for Olympic medals — is one of the great storylines of this event.

### Austria's Young Gun
At just 23, Stefan is one of the youngest serious contenders. He started jumping at age four and has developed rapidly, moving from junior ranks to consistent World Cup top-5 performer.

### Felbermayr Sponsorship
Both Rettenegger brothers serve as brand ambassadors for Felbermayr, an Austrian construction and logistics company. ([Felbermayr](https://www.felbermayr.cc/en/news/detail/brand-ambassadors-thomas-and-stefan-rettenegger))

### Jumping Advantage
The Rettenegger brothers' biggest advantage is their jumping — Thomas is this season's best jumper, and Stefan is not far behind. On the normal hill at Predazzo, a big jump could give them a decisive time advantage.
