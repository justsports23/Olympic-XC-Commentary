## Background: The Birth of Chinese Nordic Combined
Zhao Zihe's story is inseparable from the story of Nordic Combined in China:
- **2012:** Started as a cross-country skier at age 12 ([FIS - Get to know Jiawen & Zihe Zhao](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/get-to-know-jiawen-zihe-zhao-chn))
- **2016:** His coach became China's national Nordic Combined coach and persuaded Zihe to try the discipline. China began forming its NC national team specifically for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics ([FIS - Get to know](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/get-to-know-jiawen-zihe-zhao-chn), [Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240131/a1997f2102464b6faa2762815b426077/c.html))
- **2018:** Became a regular on the Continental Cup circuit ([FIS - Get to know](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/get-to-know-jiawen-zihe-zhao-chn))
- **2019:** First World Championships appearance at Seefeld ([FIS - Get to know](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/get-to-know-jiawen-zihe-zhao-chn))
- The initial squad of 20 was reduced to just 5 athletes, including Zhao Zihe and Zhao Jiawen, showing the difficulty of building a program from scratch ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240131/a1997f2102464b6faa2762815b426077/c.html))

## Technique & Format Profile
- **Cross-country background:** Started as a cross-country skier, giving him a stronger skiing base than many jumper-turned-combined athletes ([FIS - Get to know](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/get-to-know-jiawen-zihe-zhao-chn))
- **Jumping:** Has improved steadily but jumping remains the area needing most development
- **Best format:** Individual Gundersen events; also effective in team formats (10th at Beijing 2022 in team event)
- **Trajectory:** The 19th-place result at Lillehammer (Feb 2025) represents a genuine breakthrough after years of development

## Key Storylines
### From Cross-Country Skier to Olympic Nordic Combined Athlete
Zhao Zihe did not grow up dreaming of Nordic Combined -- the sport barely existed in China when he was young. He was a cross-country skier from age 12 until his coach pivoted to become China's first NC national coach in 2016 and brought Zihe along. In just six years, he went from never having ski jumped to competing at the Olympics. His idol? Jarl Magnus Riiber, whom he calls "the King of Nordic Combined" ([FIS - Get to know Jiawen & Zihe Zhao](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/get-to-know-jiawen-zihe-zhao-chn)).

### The Zhao Duo -- China's Nordic Combined Pioneers
Zhao Zihe and his teammate Zhao Jiawen (BIB 8) are the two pillars of Chinese Nordic Combined. While they share a surname, they are not related -- but their careers have been intertwined since 2016. Zhao Jiawen is the more famous of the two (he lit the Olympic cauldron at Beijing 2022 alongside Dinigeer Yilamujiang), but Zhao Zihe has been equally important to the program's development. They have competed as a team at Continental Cup team sprint events and were part of the team event at Beijing 2022 ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20220211/5dcbda6475e948679209578bc1387af9/c.html), [China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202402/02/WS65bc43dfa3104efcbdae9403.html)).

### Building a Sport from Nothing
China's Nordic Combined program is one of the most remarkable development stories in winter sports. The entire program was created from scratch in 2016 with the specific goal of competing at the Beijing 2022 home Olympics. From 20 initial recruits, only 5 survived the training demands. That Zhao Zihe is still competing four years later at a second Olympics -- and improving his results -- speaks to the program's durability beyond its original Beijing 2022 purpose ([Xinhua - Zhao on course for greater breakthrough](https://english.news.cn/20240131/a1997f2102464b6faa2762815b426077/c.html)).

### Post-Beijing Progress
Zhao Jiawen noted after Beijing 2022 that "if we can compete at the next Winter Olympics, we will definitely achieve a greater breakthrough." Zhao Zihe has lived up to that promise: his Continental Cup results have improved significantly, with his 19th-place finish at Lillehammer in 2025 representing a level of competitiveness unimaginable when the program started ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240131/a1997f2102464b6faa2762815b426077/c.html)).

## Personal Life
- **Mother:** Yuan Hongxia — the most influential figure in his athletic career. When Zhao wanted to quit ski jumping during training in Hokkaido, Japan, terrified of the 100-meter jump, she told him: "Once you've made a choice, you can't give up halfway." She initially wanted him to focus on studies but later became his strongest supporter ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240131/a1997f2102464b6faa2762815b426077/c.html))
- **Childhood:** Was a top student until 3rd grade, when his P.E. teacher Wang Zhiru spotted his athletic talent. His first sport was long-distance running ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240131/a1997f2102464b6faa2762815b426077/c.html))
- **Origin story:** Started cross-country skiing at age 11 in 2012. After only 20 days of practice, he finished 7th in a provincial youth competition — showing natural talent ([FIS - Get to know Jiawen & Zihe Zhao](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/get-to-know-jiawen-zihe-zhao-chn))
- **Switched to Nordic Combined in 2016** when his cross-country coach became China's national NC coach and recruited him ([FIS - Get to know](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/get-to-know-jiawen-zihe-zhao-chn))
- **Crisis moment:** During training in Japan, he was so scared of ski jumping that he wanted to quit and go back to school. His mother's words convinced him to stay ([Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/20240131/a1997f2102464b6faa2762815b426077/c.html))
- **Personality:** High discipline, studies competition videos in his spare time. Describes skiing as bringing "pure happiness" ([China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202402/02/WS65bc43dfa3104efcbdae9403.html))
- **Role model:** Jarl Magnus Riiber, whom he calls "the King of Nordic Combined" ([FIS - Get to know](https://www.fis-ski.com/en/nordic-combined/nordic-combined-news-multimedia/news-multimedia/news/2020-21/get-to-know-jiawen-zihe-zhao-chn))
- **Family finances:** The family could not initially afford professional athlete expenses — making his Olympic journey all the more remarkable
