## Key Storylines

### Breaking the Drought
Schmid ended a nearly three-year World Cup win drought in Otepää this season. His last individual victories had come in 2022-23 in Oberstdorf. The Otepää wins showed he's rediscovered his best form heading into the Olympics.

### Germany's Third Man
Germany sends three athletes — Geiger (defending champion), Rydzek (2018 gold medalist), and Schmid. Any of them could medal. Schmid's consistency (3rd overall) makes him arguably the most reliable of the three.

### "The Golden Ticket"
Schmid has spoken about the intense internal competition within Germany for Olympic spots: "It's a tough fight for the golden ticket." ([FIS](https://www.fis-ski.com/nordic-combined/news/2025-26/julian-schmid-it-s-a-tough-fight-for-the-golden-ticket-))

### World Championship Pedigree
With 3 silvers at Planica 2023 and team gold at Trondheim 2025, Schmid has proven he performs at major championships.
