## Key Storylines

### The Breakout Star
Skoglund went from a career-best 7th to back-to-back podiums in the space of weeks heading into the Olympics. At 24, he's arriving at his first Olympics with perfect timing.

"It really means a lot; it was really fun having a podium. It feels like there are good opportunities for the future now; I am very happy."

### Norway's Third Man
Behind the Oftebro brothers, Skoglund has emerged as Norway's crucial third athlete. His maiden podium came in the same race where Einar Oftebro won his first WC — making it a dream day for the Norwegian team.
