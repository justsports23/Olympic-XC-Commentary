## Key Storylines

### The Defending Champion
Geiger is the defending Olympic champion in this exact event — Individual Gundersen Normal Hill/10km. At Beijing 2022, he produced a thrilling comeback on the cross-country course, catching the leaders in the final kilometers. Can he do it again?

### German Pedigree
Germany has won 4 of the last 5 individual NH Olympic gold medals. Geiger is joined by teammates Johannes Rydzek (2018 LH gold medalist) and Julian Schmid. The German team has an incredible Olympic record.

### Slow Start, Perfect Timing
Geiger started the 2025-26 season slowly — 10th overall entering the Seefeld Triple. But his Compact victory at Seefeld showed he is back to his best form just one week before the Olympics. Olympic pedigree athletes often peak for the Games.
