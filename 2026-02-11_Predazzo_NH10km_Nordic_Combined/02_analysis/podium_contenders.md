# Podium Contenders — Individual Gundersen Normal Hill / 10km

## Gold Medal Favorite

### 1. Johannes Lamparter (AUT) — BIB 36
**World Cup Leader | 22+ Career Wins | 5 Wins This Season**

Lamparter is the overwhelming favorite. He leads the 2025-26 World Cup with 1,122 points, has won 5 of the first 14 events this season, and is dominant in both jumping and cross-country. He opened the season with a statement — winning the Ruka Tour — and has barely looked back.

**Why he wins:** Complete athlete; elite jumper AND skier. No clear weakness. If he jumps well, he goes into the XC with a lead and the legs to extend it. If he jumps poorly, he has the XC ability to chase down anyone.

**Risk factor:** His Beijing 2022 result (7th) shows that being the World Cup leader doesn't guarantee Olympic gold. Olympic pressure and one-off format (single jump, not a season's accumulation) adds variance.

## Primary Podium Contenders

### 2. Jens Luraas Oftebro (NOR) — BIB 35
**WC 2nd | Best Skier Trophy Leader | Beijing 2022 Silver Medalist**

The fastest pure cross-country skier in the field (1,213 pts in Best Skier Trophy). If Oftebro can stay within reasonable jumping distance of the leaders, his XC legs can carry him to the podium or even gold. His Beijing 2022 silver medal proves he performs on the biggest stage.

**Why he podiums:** The best skier in the field. In a 10km race, he can close enormous time gaps. He has Olympic big-stage experience (gold + silver at Beijing 2022).

**Risk factor:** Jumping. If he has a poor jump and starts 1+ minutes behind the leaders, even his elite skiing may not be enough to close the gap.

### 3. Julian Schmid (GER) — BIB 34
**WC 3rd | 2 Wins This Season | 2023 World Championship 3x Silver**

Schmid is the most consistent German this season (3rd overall, 853 pts) and rediscovered his winning form in Otepää. His World Championship pedigree (3 silvers at Planica 2023, team gold at Trondheim 2025) shows he rises to major championship occasions.

**Why he podiums:** Remarkably consistent; 3rd in the overall standings. Wins in both Mass Start and PCR format this season. Good jumper and good skier — no exploitable weakness.

**Risk factor:** His 3-year win drought before this season suggests he may not be at the absolute peak of his powers, despite the recent breakthrough.

### 4. Stefan Rettenegger (AUT) — BIB 32
**WC 5th | 3 Podiums This Season | Strong Jumper**

The younger Rettenegger is having his best-ever World Cup season. At 23, he's Austria's second-strongest athlete and a genuine medal contender. His jumping is among the best in the field, giving him the potential for a lead going into the XC.

**Why he podiums:** Big jumper — could take a significant lead after the ski jumping phase. Three podiums this season show consistency. Part of a deep Austrian team with strong preparation.

**Risk factor:** His cross-country skiing, while improving, may not match the top skiers (Oftebro, Lamparter) if they start close behind him.

### 5. Vinzenz Geiger (GER) — BIB 28
**Defending Olympic Champion | 2024-25 Crystal Globe | Seefeld Compact Winner**

Geiger is the ultimate Olympic performer — 2 Olympic golds across 2018 and 2022. He started this season slowly (~10th overall) but his Compact victory at the Seefeld Triple one week before the Olympics showed he is peaking at exactly the right time. Germany has won 4 of the last 5 individual NH golds.

**Why he podiums:** Olympic DNA. He's done it before at this exact event (defending champion). His Seefeld win shows he's back to his best. Sprint finish ability is elite.

**Risk factor:** Inconsistent season overall — his Seefeld win may have been a one-off peak rather than sustained form. At 28, his best years may have been the 2024-25 Crystal Globe season.

## Podium Prediction

| Medal | Athlete | Rationale |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Gold** | Johannes Lamparter (AUT) | Dominant WC leader, complete athlete, no clear weakness |
| **Silver** | Jens Luraas Oftebro (NOR) | Best skier in the field, Olympic pedigree, can chase anyone down |
| **Bronze** | Vinzenz Geiger (GER) or Julian Schmid (GER) | Germany's Olympic legacy + Geiger's defending champion status; Schmid's consistency is the steady alternative |

**Wildcard for podium:** Thomas Rettenegger (AUT) — best jumper on the circuit. If he has a huge jump and builds a big lead, the 10km may not be enough for the chasers to catch him.
