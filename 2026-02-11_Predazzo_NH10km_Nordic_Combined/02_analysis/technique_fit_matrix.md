# Technique Fit Matrix — Normal Hill / 10km Gundersen at Predazzo/Tesero

## Race Demands

This specific event rewards:
1. **Normal hill jumping consistency** (HS106 — not huge distances, technique over power)
2. **10km freestyle XC** (shorter than 15km — less time to chase; favors jumpers slightly more)
3. **Sprint finish ability** (normal hill = compressed gaps = more group finishes)
4. **Wet snow/near-0°C wax adaptability** (forecast is near freezing)
5. **Altitude:** ~1,000m — not a factor

### Rating Key
- ★★★★★ = Elite / World-class
- ★★★★ = Strong / Top-tier
- ★★★ = Good / Competitive
- ★★ = Developing / Average
- ★ = Below average for this level

## Key Takeaways

1. **Lamparter is the only athlete with elite ratings across ALL categories.** This is why he's the clear favorite.

2. **The normal hill compresses the field.** Unlike the large hill, gaps will be smaller. This means the XC leg is MORE decisive — favoring Jens Oftebro and the strong skiers.

3. **Austria's depth is unique.** They have THREE athletes with strong jumping (★★★★★ or ★★★★), which means they're likely to have multiple athletes near the front after jumping. This creates tactical options.

4. **Sprint finish ability is crucial.** With compressed gaps, the race likely comes down to a group sprint. Geiger (2022 sprint finish gold), J. Oftebro, E. Oftebro, and Rydzek are the best sprint finishers.

5. **Wax conditions favor well-resourced teams.** Near-0°C conditions are the hardest to wax for. Norway, Germany, and Austria have the best wax teams — smaller nations (Estonia, China, Ukraine) may lose 15-30 seconds on wax alone.
