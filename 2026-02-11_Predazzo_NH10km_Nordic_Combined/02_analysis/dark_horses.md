# Dark Horses — Individual Gundersen Normal Hill / 10km

Athletes outside the top 5 favorites who could surprise with a medal.

---

## 1. Thomas Rettenegger (AUT) — BIB 31
**Season's Best Jumper | Ramsau Mass Start Winner**

**The Case:** Thomas has been described as "this season's best jumper at the World Cup." In a normal hill Gundersen, a dominant jump gives you a time lead that can be protected on the cross-country course. If Rettenegger lands a massive jump and starts the 10km with a 30-40 second lead, he could hold on for a medal even against stronger skiers.

**Evidence:** Won the Ramsau Mass Start in December 2025. Has three podium finishes this season. Austria's team preparation is clearly elite given all three of their athletes are medal contenders.

**Risk:** His cross-country skiing is not among the top tier. If the best skiers (Oftebro, Lamparter) start within 20 seconds of him, they will likely catch him.

## 2. Einar Luraas Oftebro (NOR) — BIB 33
**WC 4th | Maiden WC Winner This Season | Peak Form**

**The Case:** Einar is having the best season of his career — 4th overall, his first-ever World Cup victory, and multiple podiums. He's riding a wave of confidence. His emotional breakthrough in Otepää ("never give up, trust your process") shows an athlete who has found something special this season.

**Evidence:** 4th in the World Cup standings. Won a sprint finish against veteran Rydzek in Otepää. At 27, he's in his physical prime. His brother Jens's success at Beijing 2022 (gold + silver) proves the Oftebro genes can deliver on the Olympic stage.

**Risk:** His career prior to this season was unremarkable (career-best 7th place before this year). The question is whether his breakthrough form is sustainable under Olympic pressure.

## 3. Ilkka Herola (FIN) — BIB 30
**Four-Time Olympian | Strong Skier | Val di Fiemme Experience**

**The Case:** Herola competed at Val di Fiemme as early as 2013 for the World Championships. He knows the courses intimately. Finland's cross-country skiing tradition means his XC leg is strong. At 30, he has vast experience and a cool head under pressure. His 4th place at the King's Cup in Oslo showed podium potential.

**Evidence:** 4th Olympics. Knows Val di Fiemme well. Finland's XC tradition. WC debut at 16 — enormously experienced.

**Risk:** No World Cup victories or podiums in recent seasons. Would need a career-best performance to reach the Olympic podium.

## Honorable Mentions

### Andreas Skoglund (NOR) — BIB 27
Two maiden podiums in January 2026 show he's peaking at the right time. At 24, he has nothing to lose. But his World Cup career before this season lacked podium results, making a medal a genuine upset.

### Eero Hirvonen (FIN) — BIB 25
5th at PyeongChang 2018 — the best Finnish Olympic NC result. Proven big-stage performer but has been less consistent in recent seasons.

### Akito Watabe (JPN) — BIB 21
The legend competing in his 6th Olympics. No one has more experience. If conditions favor a veteran's craft (tricky wind, wet snow), Watabe's 20 years of experience could be an edge. A medal would be a fairy-tale ending to an incredible career.
