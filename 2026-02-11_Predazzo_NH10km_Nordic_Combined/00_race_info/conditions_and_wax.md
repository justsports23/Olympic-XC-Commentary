# Conditions & Wax — 11 February 2026, Val di Fiemme

## Weather Forecast

### General Outlook (February 11, 2026)
The 11–15 February window is described as the most disruption-prone period of the Games, with mixed precipitation and variable visibility. Valleys and mid-elevations near Val di Fiemme are expected to hover near the melting line, swinging between snow, wet snow, and rain.

### Expected Conditions

| Parameter | Forecast |
|-----------|----------|
| **Air Temperature** | Near 0°C (freezing/thawing line), estimated -2°C to +3°C |
| **Snow Temperature** | Near 0°C, with potential for wet snow |
| **Precipitation** | Mixed — possible snow showers with wet snow or rain |
| **Wind** | Light to moderate; gusty conditions possible on the jump hill ridgeline |
| **Visibility** | Variable, potential for reduced visibility in snow showers |
| **Cloud Cover** | Mostly cloudy with occasional sunny spells |
| **Humidity** | Moderate to high |

### Key Weather Impacts

1. **Ski Jumping:** Gusty wind conditions on the Predazzo hill could be a significant factor. Wind conditions have historically affected competitions at this venue. Wind guards and compensation calculations will be critical.

2. **Cross-Country:** Near-freezing temperatures create challenging wax conditions. The transition from slush during daytime warming to refreezing at night means course conditions can change rapidly.

3. **Course Conditions:** The melting-line conditions mean the snow surface could be soft and wet, favoring athletes with good glide wax setups and those comfortable in slushy conditions.

## Wax Considerations

### Temperature Zone
- With air temperatures hovering around 0°C and potential for wet snow, this falls into a notoriously tricky "zero degree" wax zone
- Fluorocarbon-free regulations (FIS ban on fluorinated wax since 2023/24) add complexity

### Brand Advantages
- [DATA NOT FOUND] — specific wax test results and brand advantages not yet available pre-race

### General Wax Strategy for ~0°C Wet Conditions
- Warm-range hydrocarbon base waxes
- Structure patterns suited for wet snow (coarser structure)
- Glide products optimized for water content in the snow
- Teams will be testing extensively on race morning

## Altitude Impact
- At approximately 1,000m elevation, altitude is not a significant performance factor
- No meaningful physiological advantage for any particular national team
