## Format Explanation

The Gundersen format is the standard Nordic Combined competition format:

1. **Ski Jumping Phase (Normal Hill HS106):** All 36 athletes take one competition jump from the normal hill at Predazzo. Scores are calculated based on distance and style points. The athlete with the highest jumping score starts the cross-country race first.

2. **Cross-Country Phase (10km Freestyle):** Jumping scores are converted into time gaps using the Gundersen method (each jumping point = a set number of seconds). Athletes start the 10km cross-country race at intervals corresponding to their jumping scores. The first athlete to cross the finish line wins the gold medal.

This format rewards the most complete athlete — one who can both jump far and ski fast.

## Key Changes from Beijing 2022

- **Reduced field:** Only 36 athletes compete, down from 55 at Beijing 2022 — a reduction of nearly one-third ([NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/nordic-combined-2026-milan-cortina-winter-olympics))
- **Maximum 3 athletes per NOC** (down from previous limits)
- **Team event changes:** The team event will feature 2-person teams racing 7.5km legs, rather than 4-person teams with 5km legs
- **Historic context:** This may be the **last time Nordic Combined appears at the Olympics** — the IOC is considering dropping the sport after 2026 due to limited international participation and the absence of women's events ([Powder Magazine](https://www.powder.com/news/ioc-considers-removing-winter-sports))

## Historical Significance

Nordic Combined has been part of the Winter Olympic program since the very first Winter Olympics in Chamonix, 1924 — making it one of the original winter sports. If dropped after 2026, it would end over 100 years of Olympic tradition.

The sport is also the **last remaining Olympic discipline without women's competition**, a fact that has drawn significant criticism. American athlete Annika Malacinski (sister of competitor Niklas Malacinski, BIB 22) has been particularly vocal: "Men will not go to 2030 if women don't go. Their way to solve gender equality will be by taking away the sport." ([The Concordian](https://theconcordian.com/2026/02/why-women-are-still-excluded-from-olympic-nordic-combined/))
