## Format Description

This is a **mass start** event in which the entire field departs simultaneously from the start line. Athletes race 50 kilometers using the **classic technique** (diagonal stride, double poling, herringbone — no skating). The first athlete to cross the finish line wins. In mass start races, positioning, drafting, pacing, and tactical surges are critical factors, unlike interval-start races where athletes race against the clock.

The 50km mass start classic is the marathon event of the cross-country skiing program — the longest and most grueling race on the schedule. It demands exceptional endurance, pacing discipline, classic technique efficiency over extreme distance, and the tactical acumen to manage a large pack over several hours of racing.

## HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE

**This is a landmark event in the history of cross-country skiing and the Olympic Games.**

For the first time in Olympic history, women will race the 50km distance. Previously, the longest women's cross-country skiing event at the Olympics was the 30km. Beginning with the Milano Cortina 2026 Games, the women's distance program has been equalized to match the men's, with the women's marathon distance extended from 30km to 50km.

This change represents a major step forward for **gender equality in cross-country skiing** and in Olympic sport more broadly. Women have long demonstrated their capability at ultra-distance events — the Vasaloppet (90km), Marcialonga (70km), and other Ski Classics marathon events have featured women racing extreme distances for decades. The equalization of Olympic distances formally recognizes this capability at the highest level of competition.

The decision to extend the women's marathon distance was part of the FIS's broader efforts toward program parity between men and women in cross-country skiing. It follows similar moves in other endurance sports to eliminate gender-based distance discrepancies.

## Schedule Context

The Women's 50km Mass Start Classic is traditionally the **final event of the cross-country skiing program** at the Olympic Winter Games. It is the marathon — the ultimate endurance test and the capstone of the Nordic skiing competition. This event is also expected to be one of the **final competition events of the entire Milano Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games**, taking place on the last day of competition before the Closing Ceremony.

This scheduling gives the event enormous symbolic significance: the first-ever women's Olympic 50km will serve as one of the closing acts of the Games.
