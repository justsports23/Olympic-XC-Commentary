## Typical February Conditions in Val di Fiemme

Based on historical weather data for Tesero, Val di Fiemme in mid-to-late February:

- **Air Temperature:** Typically ranges from -5C to +5C during daytime racing hours. Morning starts can be colder.
- **Snow Temperature:** Often below zero at 10:00 CET start time, potentially warming through the midday hours as the race progresses over 2+ hours.
- **Conditions Trend:** Late February can bring variable conditions — anything from fresh snowfall and cold temperatures to mild, spring-like conditions with soft snow. The Dolomite valley location means the venue can be sheltered from wind but is susceptible to temperature inversions.
- **Snow Quality:** By late February, the snowpack is typically well-established. Machine-made snow supplements natural cover on the race course. The snow may become transformed (older, granular crystals) rather than fresh.

**50km Race Duration Consideration:** Because this race will last approximately 2-2.5 hours (potentially longer), conditions may change significantly from start to finish. Temperature warming during the race is a critical wax consideration — grip wax that works at -3C at 10:00 may fail in +2C conditions by 12:00.

## Wax Considerations

### General Wax Notes for 50km Classic at This Venue

- **Grip Wax:** The 50km classic demands reliable kick wax or skin skis that provide consistent grip over the entire distance. Wax failure in a 50km race is catastrophic — athletes cannot stop to re-wax without losing enormous time.
- **Skin Skis vs. Traditional Wax:** The use of skin skis has become increasingly common at the World Cup level. In a 50km race with potentially changing conditions, skin skis offer more consistent grip but may sacrifice some glide compared to perfectly waxed skis.
- **Glide Wax:** With 50km of distance, even small glide advantages compound over the full race. Team wax technicians will be testing extensively on race morning.
- **Temperature Transitions:** If temperatures warm during the race (typical for a morning start extending into midday), the initial wax choice must account for the full range of expected conditions. This is one of the most challenging aspects of wax preparation for a 50km classic race.
- **Fluorocarbon Regulations:** FIS fluorocarbon wax bans are in effect. All teams must use fluorocarbon-free glide products.
