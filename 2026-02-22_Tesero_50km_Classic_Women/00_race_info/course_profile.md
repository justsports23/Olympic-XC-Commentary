## Course Configuration

The 50km event will almost certainly use a **multi-lap format** on a shorter loop course rather than a single 50km point-to-point course. This is standard practice at major championships for logistical reasons (TV coverage, spectator access, nutrition/feed zones, and course maintenance).

Likely configurations include:
- 5 x 10km laps
- 10 x 5km laps
- Some combination of different loop lengths

The exact lap configuration will be confirmed when the official course map is published.

**Note:** The course elevation at approximately 900-1,000m is a moderate altitude that may have a mild physiological impact on performance, particularly in the later stages of a 50km race. This is not considered true altitude racing (which typically begins above 1,500m), but the reduced oxygen availability may compound fatigue effects over the marathon distance.

## Known Course Characteristics (Val di Fiemme)

Based on previous World Cup, Tour de Ski, and World Championship events at this venue:

- **Terrain:** Val di Fiemme courses feature rolling terrain with a mix of sustained climbs, technical descents, and flat/rolling sections through the valley.
- **Climbing:** The courses at Tesero include several significant climbs that reward strong uphill classic technique. The total climbing per lap is substantial for a World Cup-level course.
- **Descents:** Technical descents with turns that require skilled downhill technique. In classic races, descents in set tracks demand balance and confidence.
- **Stadium Area:** The Tesero stadium features a wide finish area suitable for mass start events with multiple athletes arriving together.
- **Snow Conditions:** February in Val di Fiemme typically provides reliable natural snow cover, often supplemented with machine-made snow for course consistency.

## Altitude Considerations

- **Base elevation:** ~1,000m
- **Impact on 50km classic:** At this elevation, oxygen availability is approximately 97% of sea level. While minimal for short races, the cumulative effect over 2+ hours of maximal effort in a 50km race may contribute to increased fatigue in the final laps.
- **Acclimatization:** Most athletes on the World Cup circuit have extensive experience racing at this elevation and do not require specific altitude preparation for Val di Fiemme.
