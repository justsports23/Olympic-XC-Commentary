## Key Factors for This Race

1. **First-ever women's Olympic 50km:** No historical precedent exists for this exact event. Athletes' performances in World Cup 50km races, Ski Classics marathons, and the previous Olympic 30km will be the best available indicators.
2. **Classic technique demands:** 50km of classic skiing requires exceptional diagonal stride efficiency, double-pole endurance, and kick wax reliability over the full distance.
3. **Mass start tactics:** Pack dynamics, drafting, and the timing of decisive moves will be critical over this distance.
4. **Physical and mental endurance:** The additional 20km beyond the previous Olympic maximum (30km) will test athletes in uncharted territory for this specific competition format.
