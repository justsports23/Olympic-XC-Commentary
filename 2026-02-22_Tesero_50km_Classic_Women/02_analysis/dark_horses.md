## Special Consideration: Marathon Specialists

The extension from 30km to 50km may particularly benefit athletes with **Ski Classics marathon racing experience**. Athletes who regularly race 50-70km in the Visma Ski Classics series or other long-distance events may have a significant advantage in pacing, fueling, and mental preparation for the extra distance — even if they are not typically top-10 finishers in standard World Cup distance events.

This could create genuine upset potential and should be a primary factor in identifying dark horse candidates.
